            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TREASVRER OF HER MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties priuie chamber, VV. GACE wisheth peace and
ſaluation in Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſydering (right VVorshipfull) that ſaying of Dauid
alleaged by the Apoſtle Paul, that there is none that vnderſtandeth, none
that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth after God, that all are gone out of the vvay and become
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: me thinkes it doth liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth the blindneſſe of
mans vnderſtanding, the vvickedneſſe of his vvill, and his peruerſnes
and vnhabilitie vnto that vvhich is good. VVhereof if vve had not many
testimonies of Scripture, yet common experience vvere able to confirme the
ſame, vvhen vve daily ſee men ſo carefull to liue, and ſo careleſſe
to liue vvell. Hovvbeit this is no meruell: for as a tree vvhoſe roote is
rotten and infected vvith venimous ſappe, bringeth forth none but corrupt and
naughty frute: ſo from mans hart vvhich is corrupt and infected vvith the
venim of ſinne, can proceede nothing that is good.</p>
            <p>Novv mans vnderſtanding being blinde, he is not able of him
ſelfe to attaine to the knovvledge of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vvithout
ſome other meanes or helpe can not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for this, as our Sauiour in
the Goſpell ſayth, is life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, to knovv one onely true God, and
him vvhom he hath ſent Ieſus Christ. Againe, mans vvill being corrupt, he
is not <pb facs="tcp:9413:4"/> able to ſerue God as his dutie requireth, as to honour
him as his Lord, to obey him as his father, to truſt in him as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
and preſeruer, to be thankefull to him for his infinite benefites, &amp;c.
VVherefore leſte man being ignorant of God should be excluded from
ſaluation, or leſt through the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of his vvill and inclination to
euill, he should disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo high a Lord, diſobey ſo good a father,
diſtruſt ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a preſeruer, and be vnthankefull to ſo gracious
a giuer, vvho doth not ſee hovv requiſite and needefull it is, that he
should by good inſtructions be brought to the knovvledge of the Lorde God,
and by godly exhortations and admonitions be reclaimed from his vvicked vvayes
to the performance of his dutie? Novv foraſmuch as God hath in his vvord
reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo much of him ſelfe as is expedient for man to knovv, &amp; hath
therein alſo preſcribed that maner of ſeruing him vvhereof be accepteth,
man must out of it learne the true knovvledge and right ſeruice of God, and
therefore moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is that this vvord be preached &amp; taught,
that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man may learne to knovv God, and truely to vvorship &amp; ſerue
him being knovvne. So shall his minde be enlightened vvith diuine knovvledge,
and his vvill reformed according to Gods vvil, ſo shall this vvord be a
lanterne vnto his feete, and a light vnto his paths, vvhereby he may be
directed in al his vvayes. But (alas) this is a thing to be lamented, that the
harueſt is great, but the labourers are fevv. For among them vvhich ſupply
the places of labourers in the Lordes haruest, ſome there be vvho doe vvith
diligence diſcharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, many moe there are, vvho albeit they be
able, yet doe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quite neglect it, or very ſcle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly execute it, but
greateſt is the number of them, vvho for lacke of ſkil &amp; knovvledge are
not able at all to performe it. VVherefore there is great neede to pray the
Lord of the harueſt, that he vvill ſend forth labourers into his harueſt,
vvhereby many moe then doe may receiue the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus euen
to the ſaluation of <pb facs="tcp:9413:4"/> their ſoules.</p>
            <p>The premiſſes vvell vveyed, I thinke (right VVorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
there may a ſufficient reaſon be gathered, vvhy I did purpoſe the
publishing of theſe Sermons of D. Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our vulgar tongue, and
vvhy at the laſt I haue by ſome labour and paynes brought the ſayd
purpoſed publishing to paſſe. I vvas in deede at the first procured
thereunto by a learned Father of this lande, vvhoſe vvordes and iudgement I
make no ſmall account of, but aftervvard entring into dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conſideration
of the matter, and vveying on the one ſide the great ignorance of many euen
in matters of ſaluation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither vvith the dayly dishonouring of God by
vngodly life: and on the other ſide the diuine doctrine and moſt vvholſom
exhortations vvhich theſe Sermons conteine, I vvas more forcibly ſtirred vp
thereunto, and thought that the painefull peruſing of them, and frutefull
follovving of that vvhereof they entreat, vvould be a ſouereigne ſalue to
help to cure ſuch daungerous diſeaſes. For by them may they learne to
knovv one onely true God, and vvhom he hath ſent Ieſus Chriſt, and the
infinit riches vvhich are compriſed in him, and offered vnto vs through him
of God his Father: that he humbled him ſelfe to exalt vs, that he became a
ſeruaunt to ſet vs at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he vvas empouerished to make vs rich,
that he dyed for our ſinnes, &amp; roſe again for our iuſtification, that
through his meanes mercie hath ſvvallovved vp miſerie, and bounty hath
ouercome all euill, finally that vvithout him there is no ioy nor
conſolation, no peace nor quietnes, no felicitie nor ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but that
he is the onely meanes by vvhich all good thinges are attained: ſo that they
vvhich enioy him receiue not one gift alone, as vvith Salomon vviſedom, vvith
Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtrength, vvith Iob patience, vvith Paule zeale, &amp;c: but for
pouertie they receiue riches, for vveakenes ſtrength, for folly vviſedom,
for ſeruitude freedom, for griefe ioy, for ſinne righteouſnes, for death
life, yea all good thinges vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9413:5"/>VVherefore if the faithfull man be preſſed vvith
pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he may here learne that by Christ he is adopted to be the Sonne of
God, and ſo may be comforted, ſaying to him ſelfe: Hovv can he be poore
vvhich hath God to his Father? vvho both is able to giue all thinges
neceſſary, for his is the earth and all that therein is, and alſo vvill
giue the ſame, becauſe he is moſt louing and gracious to his children.
Againe, if he feele in him ſelfe vveaknes, he may learne here that he is not
able of him ſelfe to attaine vnto ſtrength, but that it is the gift of
Chriſt, vvho ſtrengtheneth ſuch as beleeue in him, &amp; ſo may be
ſtirred vp by harty prayer to aſke the ſame of him, that he vvill
vouchſafe by his holy ſpirit to ſtrengthen and confirme him, that he may
be able to performe that by grace, vvhich by nature and of him ſelfe he shall
neuer be able to doe: as mightely to ſubdue the rebellious flesh, ſtrongly
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and at the laſt valiauntly to ouercome the tentations of
Satan, patiently to beare the troubles of the vvorld, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to
contemne the allurements of the ſame. Moreouer, if he thirſt after diuine
and heauenly vviſedom, (vvhich is to knovv God aright, and thoſe thinges
that are neceſſary to be knovvne to the attaining of ſaluation) he may
finde here largely and liuely ſet forth, that Chriſt came his Fathers
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour and Meſſenger to men, that by him they might be brought to
the right knovvledge of God, and into all truth, ſo that by him vve are
enlightened vvith the knovvledge of God, by him vve are inſtructed in all
truth, and conſequently by him vve obtaine diuine and heauenly vviſedom.
Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo shall he learne that Chriſt vvas made vnder the lavve, that he
might redeeme them vvhich vvere in bondage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lavve, &amp; of ſeruile
bondmen make them free ſonnes, euen the children of God.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if griefe and heauines come vpon him, he is here
taught vvhere true ioy may be had, euen in Chriſt <pb facs="tcp:9413:5"/> Ieſus alone,
that in him onely he may fynde ſure comfort, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne medicines,
preſent remedie, true ioy of heart and quietnes of conſcience. Finally,
vvhereas vve are ſynnefull, and haue by our ſynnes iuſtly deſerued Gods
eternall vvrath and moſt heauie vengeance, he shall here learne that Chriſt
hath payed the ranſome for our ſynnes, and pacified Gods moſt grieuous
vvrath and diſpleaſure iuſtly conceiued againſt vs. And becauſe it is
not ſufficient that due ſatisfaction be made for ſynnes, and Gods vvrath
appeaſed, but vve muſt alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare righteous before God, it is here
shevved, that as by one mans diſobedience many vvere made ſynners, ſo by
the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one, namely of Ieſus Chriſt, as many as beleeue in him
shalbe made righteous, inaſmuch as his righteouſnes is imputed to them as
their ovvne, vvhereby they appeare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous before God, and are
accepted of him: ſo that vvhereas they had of themſelues deſerued
eternall death, they are through Chriſt accounted vvorthie of euerlaſting
life. But vvhat doe I goe about to rehearſe the infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures vvhich
the faithfull enioy through Chriſt? it shall be ſufficient to conclude
vvith the Apoſtle Paule, and ſay: If God ſpared not his ovvne Sonne, but
gaue him for vs all to death, hovv shall he not vvith him giue vs all thinges
alſo?</p>
            <p>Novv foraſmuch as theſe thinges, and the right meanes to
attaine vnto them, are in theſe Sermons of that moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuine Martin
Luther moſt learnedly, yea euen diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth, they may vndoutedly be
a ſingular meane, not onely to inſtruct them vvhich be ignorant in matters
of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but alſo to increaſe and confirme the knovvledge of
ſuch, as haue already vvell profited in Chriſtian religion. Hovvbeit there
is annexed hereunto ſound and abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning good vvorkes
and godly conuerſation, as being moſt neceſſary to be of all
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s perfectly knovvne, and effectually follovved. For Chriſtians
through Chriſt being become the Sonnes of God, hovv vnmeete, yea hovv 
<pb facs="tcp:9413:6"/> abhominable a thinge is it that they should reſemble Satan in
their doinges? being novv made the members of Chriſt, hovv deteſtable a
thing is it that they should be inſtruments of iniquitie? being novv the
temple of the holy Ghoſt, hovv beaſtly a thinge vvere it to defyle the
ſame vvith the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſynne? Finally hauing receiued ſo many and
ſo great benefites of God through Chriſt, hovv vvicked and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a
thinge should it be, to be vnthankefull to ſo gracious a God, to be
diſobedient to ſo louing a Father, in any vviſe to diſpleaſe ſo
mercifull a Sauiour? But it shalbe needeleſſe much to ſtand vpon this
point, ſeeing it is not vnknovvne to the faithfull vvith hovv great endeuour
they ought to auoyde that vvhich is euill, and embrace that vvhich is good, and
therefore shall ſyncere &amp; perfect doctrine concerning good vvorkes be
vnto them no leſſe commodious and profitable, then needefull and
neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>For the cauſes aboue ſpecified eſpecially among other, I
haue (right VVorshipfull) though not finely, yet faithfully tranſlated
theſe Sermons into our vulgar tounge, and haue done myne endeuour for the
publishing of the ſame, vvhich I doe humbly dedicate to your VVorships
protection, by your zealous godlines and godly zeale chiefly moued thereunto,
vvhereby I am induced to thinke that you vvill vvell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them. For as
the godly do vvith Dauid delight in the Arke of the Couenant, in the Tabernacle
of the Lord, in the holy Mount Sion, that is, in the Church of God: ſo doe
they vvith the ſame Dauid deſyre the building of this houſe of God, the
florishing of this vine, the peace and proſperitie of this heauenly
Ieruſalem, and therefore that vvhich is a meane and furtherance hereunto they
doe not onely loue and like, but alſo hiely eſteeme, and hartily praye for.
VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (right VVorshipfull) I thinke it altogether ſuperfluous to goe
about vvith vvordes to procure your vvell liking and accepting of theſe
Sermons, foraſmuch as they tend onely to <pb facs="tcp:9413:6"/> this ende, that the
Church of God may by them be edified, as in the premiſſes is of me
declared. VVhereas in tranſlating them I haue vſed a plaine kynde of
ſtile (yet ſuch as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſſeth the meaning of the
author) and not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died for curious vvordes &amp; eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t phraſes, the
cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, for that I preferre plainneſſe vvith profit, before
much curioſitie vvith ſmaller commoditie, ſo that I nothinge at all feare
that in this reſpect they shalbe miſliked of the godly, vvhoſe
miſliking onely I endeuour to auoide.</p>
            <p>Thus (as it ſeemes vnto me) hauing intreated ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of
thoſe thinges vvhich I thought pertinent to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, I doe
here conclude, deſyring the Lord God, that he vvill by his holy Spirit
alvvayes gouerne and direct you in the true obedience of his bleſſed
vvorde, to the glorie of his diuine Name, to the profit of your neighbours, and
comfort of your conſcience, ſo shall you aſſuredly haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
ſucceſſe in all your affayres, and at the laſt obtaine euerlaſting
ioyes and endleſſe felicitie, by the onely meanes of Chriſt Ieſus our
Sauiour.</p>

ſhall not neede I truſt at this preſent any great diſcourſe to be
made, foraſmuch as ſo many good bookes of the ſame writer be already

of this alſo. Againe becauſe the worke it ſelfe is ſuch, conteining
ſuch matter of heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that without any further commendation
of other, it yeldeth cauſe ſufficient to commend it ſelfe. Onely this
then remaineth, to intreat and exhort the reader, but to peruſe &amp; reade
the ſame, who in ſo doing ſhall fynde I doubt not, neither to lacke great
cauſe in vs to ſet forth theſe Sermons, nor leſſe neceſſitie in
the readers to beſtow paines in peruſing and reading them, for the dignitie
of the matter, and ſingular frute therein to be found. For what more worthie
matter can be, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſet forth Chriſt in his right glorie, in his full
riches and royall eſtate to the hearts and ſoules of men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as are heauie laden and diſtreſſed in ſpirit? what more
comfortable hearinge, or doctrine more true, then of forgiuenes and
remiſſion of ſynnes, ſo graciouſly purchaſed, ſo freely offered
by our Sauiour, ſo cleerely preached by his miniſters? or what riches more
excellent, then faith fixed in Chriſt, and hope ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the
promiſes of life? or what ſtudie more frutefull, then to ſeeke the
kingdome of God? For <pb facs="tcp:9413:8"/> where the frute of all other ſtudies
decayeth and hath his ende, the frute of this ſtudy abydeth for euer. And
therefore not without cauſe we be ſo willed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour him ſelfe,
firſt to ſeeke for this kingdome and righteouſnes thereof, promiſing
withall in an other place, that he which ſeeketh ſhall fynde. In the
ſeeking of which kingdom two ſpecial notes we haue to learne and ſearch,
firſt the glorie &amp; grace of the King, ſecondly the welth and felicitie
of the ſubiects. In which two partes as the whole ſumme of all our
ſpirituall comfort moſt principally conſiſteth, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the holy

pleaſe, preaching now in their owne ſpeech vnto them, and putting them to
no charges of any tythes. And in other places where more plentie of learned
teachers is, yet notwithſtanding no hurt ſhall come to admit this
ſtranger as a coadiutor, or felow helper vnto them. Whereby I nothing dout,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue often tymes heard this hiſtory before, and muſt
heare it ſtill both this yeare, and euery yeare, though to ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
&amp; drouſie Chriſtians, that are ſoone weary and cloyed with good
things, the ſame peraduenture may ſeeme tedious. But to them that are
endued with true faith, it alwaies commeth againe as newe. For the holy Ghoſt
can ſpeake ſo diuerſly of one thing, that to them which be his, it
alwayes ſeemeth newe. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we might ſpeake at large of this
hiſtorie, for it is very full of matter, if we ſhoulde not want tyme, and
if it were not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous leaſt we ſhoulde ſomewhere ſtraye from the
purpoſe: Neuertheles we will entreate ſomewhat thereof, as God ſhall
permit. Ye haue already heard in the text, how the Angell him ſelfe
expreſſeth all this hiſtory, giuing vs to vnderſtand, that the ſame
is publiſhed for our cauſe: and that the frute thereof doth redounde and
appertaine to vs onely, and is wrought to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And therefore the
Angell ſpeaking to the ſhepeheards, ſayth in theſe wordes: <hi>Be not
afraide, behold, I bringe you ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great ioy which shall be vnto all
people, that is, that vnto you is borne this day in the city of Dauid a
Sauiour, which <pb n="4" facs="tcp:9413:11"/> is Chriſt the Lorde.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt came not for his owne cauſe, but to worke our
ſaluation</note> Here is declared firſt, that his natiuitie doth pertaine
vnto vs, when he ſayth: <hi>vnto you is borne a Sauiour.</hi> For the Lord
Chriſt came not for his owne cauſe onely, but that he might helpe and
ſuccour vs. Wherefore let vs moſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeuour, that we beleue the
Angell, and we ſhall enioy the whole benefit. I haue heretofore oftentymes
ſayd, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell preacheth nothing elſe but faith, that the Angell
alſo here doth, and this muſt all preachers doe, otherwiſe they be not
true miniſters. For the Angell was here a beginning and example to all
preachers. Now we muſt in this place ſpeake of a double na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, namely
of our owne and of Chriſtes. But before I begin to entreat hereof, I will
handle the hiſtorye briefly, that ye may lay it vp in your hart, and may be
partakers of the ioy which the Angell here bringeth. Firſt therefore the
Euangeliſt ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it came to paſſe in thoſe dayes, that there came a
decree from Auguſtus Caeſar, that all the world should be taxed. This
firſt taxing was made when Cyrenius was gouernour of Syria. Therefore went
all to be taxed euery man to his owne citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
foretold by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Iacob. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10.</note>Ye know right wel,
that the Iewes had a promiſe made of the Patriarch Iacob, that a Prince,
lawgiuer or ruler, of the houſe of Iuda, ſhould not be wanting in Iudea,
vntil the Meſſias which was promiſed them did come. For the wordes of
Iacob to Iuda are playne after this ſort: <hi>The ſcepter shall not depart
from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp; a lawgiuer from betwene his feete, vntill Silo come.</hi> Now
at this time the caſe was ſo, that the Romanes poſſeſſed Iudea, and
had ſet a Liuetenant ouer it, whom the Euangeliſt here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Cyrenius.
The Iewes before for a long tyme had vſed prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes for Kinges, when as the
Machabees had obtayned the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo that the dominion of the houſe of
Iuda was already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away and ſuppreſſed, neither was there any Prince
or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, of the ſtocke and blood of Iuda, gouernour ouer the people. But
that Chriſt or the Meſſias ſhoulde nowe come, that was a great ſigne,
that the prophecie at that tyme eſpecially might be fulfilled. Wherefore the
Euangeliſt ſayth here, that at the tyme when Chriſt was borne, Auguſtus
Ceſar had ſet a Liuetenaunt ouer Iudea, vnder whom the Iewes ſhould offer
them ſelues to be taxed. As if he ſayd: Euen at that tyme at which he
ſhould be borne, he is borne. All that liued vnder the Romane Emperour 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9413:11"/> were compelled to pay taxe, for a teſtimonie that they
were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto him. This the Iewes knew, but they did not vnderſtand
the Prophecie. Iacob had ſayd thus: <hi>The ſcepter shal not depart from
Iuda, and a lawgiuer from betwene his feete, vntill Silo come:</hi> That is, a
Prince and ruler of the ſtocke of Iuda ſhall not be wanting in Iudea, vntil
Chriſt come. Iacob did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewe in theſe wordes,<note place="margin">The Iewes miſinterpret the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Iacob concerning the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</note> that he ſhould be wanting at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt. Moreouer, whereas they vnderſtood it ſo, as though ſuch a
Silo ſhoulde come, as ſhoulde beare rule with the ſword, it is a falſe
vnderſtanding thereof, neither can it be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of that text. For he
ſayth thus, that at the comming of Chriſt the temporall kingdome of the
Iewes ſhoulde ende. So Luke alſo here ſheweth that very time, when it
behoued this to be done. It followeth moreouer in the text:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Ioſeph alſo went vp from Galile out of a citie
called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, into Iudea, vnto the citie of Dauid, which is called
Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, (becauſe he was of the houſe and linage of Dauid) to be taxed
with Marie that was giuen him to wife, which was vvith childe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ioſeph alſo and Marie obeyed this commaundement of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,
and ſubmitted them ſelues as other honeſt and obedient men, and went to
Bethlehem, which was the chiefe and head citie of the houſe of Iuda, and
ſuffered themſelues to be taxed. Marie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ſhe was with
child, &amp; neare her deliuerie, might haue excuſed her ſelfe, that ſhe
ſhould not take this iorney vpon her, but ſhe doth not ſo, they will not
be an offence to others. Moreouer it ought thus to be that they ſhould come
to Bethlehem, becauſe of the prophecie of the Prophet Micheas chap. 5. which
foretolde that Chriſt ſhoulde be borne in Bethlehem of Iuda. Marke I pray
you, how that taxe muſt ſerue hereunto, which neither Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar nor his
Lieuetenant did knowe. Thus God dealeth in his workes, in which he vſeth the
meanes of heathen and euill men, whereby he may make vs, which are miſerable
&amp; wretched men, and ſo deepely drowned in fleſh and blood, certaine of
our faith, which the Euangeliſt Luke here ſpecially ſetteth forth,
inaſmuch as he eftſoones declareth in the hiſtorie, the places and times,
leaſt that we ſhould be deceiued concerning this Chriſt. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of
his birth the Euangeliſt ſheweth moreouer, ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:9413:12"/>
                  <hi>And ſo it was, that while they were
there, the dayes were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, that she should be deliuered: and she
brought forth her firſt begotten ſonne, and wrapped him in ſwadling
clothes, &amp; layd him in a manger, becauſe there was no roome for them in
the Inne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it nothing moue vs, or be any offence vnto vs, that the
Lorde commeth into the world in ſo great pouertie and miſerie. For it ought
to be a great ioy and comfort vnto vs, rather then in any wiſe to
diſcomfort &amp; diſcourage vs. It may ſeeme a ſtraunge thing, and hard
and ſtrait dealing, that a Virgin which was new maried, and that yeare ioyned
to her huſband, might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bring forth her childe at Nazareth
in her owne houſe, but was enforced in poore eſtate to goe almoſt three
daies iorney being great with child? And when ſhe came at her iorneyes end,
ſhe had not ſo much place in the Inne, as that ſhe might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in
ſome parlour or chamber. The Inne being full, there was none that would
vouchſafe to giue place to this woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great with childe, that ſhe
might haue the vſe of their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but ſhe was enforced to go into a
ſtable, that there ſhe might bring forth the Creator of all creatures. Here
may be plainly perceiued what is the knowledge and wiſedom of the world
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning diuine matters, namely, that it is blinde, and vaine in
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that it ſeeth not the works of God, and if it be ſo that
it ſeeth them, that it knoweth not what they meane.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly miſerie &amp;
contempt.</note>Hereof let vs learne, not to be moued or diſcouraged, if we
be poore and miſerable, and forſaken of the world, for we haue here great
comfort. If Chriſt the maker of all thinges, with his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mother, was
caſt into ſo great miſerie, and ſo contemned of the worlde, why may not
the ſame alſo come vnto vs? or why ſhould not we being in miſerie, and
compaſſed about with all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, beare them patiently, yea if God will
at any time kill vs with aduerſitie and diſtres? But this thing is to be
lamented, that we doe exclude ſuch an example from our eyes, but much farther
from our hart. We ſhould eaſily ſuffer aduerſitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if
ſo be that we beleued, and had a ſure truſt and confidence in God, when
as we ſee that the Lord Chriſt ſuffered this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, pouertie, and
calamitie. Wherefore this is firſt throughly to <pb n="7" facs="tcp:9413:12"/> be marked
and conſidered of vs, how Chriſt came into the world in ſo great
pouertie, and found not ſo much as one in ſo great a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which was
dutifull and beneficial toward him. Thus this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie was receiued in the
earth, ouer which notwithſtanding all the heauenly ſouldiers did
exceedingly reioyce, as it followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there were in the ſame contrey shepeheards, abiding in
the field and watching their flocke by night. And loe, the Angel of the Lorde
came vpon them, and the glory of the Lorde shone about them, and they were
ſore afraide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is declared,<note place="margin">How God ſetteth forth the
natiuitie of his ſonne.</note> how God in heauen ſetteth forth this
natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which the world contemneth, yea knoweth not, neither ſeeth. This
ioy is ſo great in heauen, that it can not be contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but
burſteth forth, that it may be declared and communicated to the world. For
the Angell here bringeth tydings of great ioy to the ſhepeheardes, which to
them is great comfort, which the worlde notwithſtanding contemneth and
reiecteth, but is of the Angells had in greate admiration, yea and if they
might, they would with greater prayſes, and more goodly pompe haue ſette
forth ſo wonderful a thinge. But it was not meete it ſhould be ſo. For
God would ſet forth an example in this his Sonne, that the oſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; glorying of the world might at the laſt be neglected, and that it might
be knowne what the world is. Mans reaſon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth alwayes very wiſe vnto
it ſelfe, it alwayes looketh vnto thinges that are aloft, it conſidereth
onely high matters, it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth not it ſelfe to thoſe thinges that are
below. This now is an excellent comfort, that the Angels and all the heauenly
ſouldiers doe eſteeme him ſo much, whom the world contemneth, whereby we
may learne that albeit we be outcaſts in the worlde, there be
notwithſtanding that haue regard and care of vs. Howbeit we do hardly beleeue
this, we doe not faſten our eyes thereupon, but looke vnto great, precious,
and high thinges, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the world, and are diſmayed,
as ſoone as a litle misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune commeth, neither thinking nor knowing, if any
aduerſity aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaileth vs, that it is done by the will of God. Beleue thou
this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutedly, if it had not ſo pleaſed God, he would not haue
ſuffered this his beloued ſonne to be layd in a manger, he would not haue
permitted him to be borne in ſo great pouertie, miſerie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But
the poorer and more deſpiſed that he is before the 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9413:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> world, ſo much greater care and regard God and all
the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſouldiers haue of him, ſo that we may conceiue comfort
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and beleeue aſſuredly, that the more we are reiected of the world,
the more we are eſteemed before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The blind &amp; vaine deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
many</note>Thou mayſt finde many which doe here thinke thus, and are touched
with ſuch deuotion as this: O, if I had bene there then, with howe great

haue waſhed euen his ſwadling clothes. O, if I had bene ſo happy as the
ſhepeheards, that I alſo might haue ſeene the Lord lying in a maunger.
Nowe in deede thou wouldeſt be ready to doe thoſe duties, when thou
knoweſt Chriſt to be ſo high and noble. Surely thou wouldeſt haue bene
as ſlacke in thy dutie at that time as the Citizens of Bethlehem were. Thou
reuolueſt in thy mind childiſh and altogether fooliſh cogitations. Why
dooſt thou not performe the like duties nowe? Behold Chriſt walking before
thee in thy neighbour, do for him, &amp; beſtowe benefits vpon him,
whatſoeuer thou ſhalt beſtow vpon thy neighbour which is needy and
deſtitute of helpe, that thou ſhalt beſtow vpon Chriſt him ſelfe, as
he ſhall ſay in the laſt day to the elect:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40</note> 
                  <hi>VVhatſoeuer ye haue done to one
of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye haue done it to me.</hi> Wherfore it
is a vaine and very fooliſh thing to admit ſuch childiſh cogitations. Let
vs therefore at the laſt open our eyes, let vs not heare examples of ſo
great importance in vaine, otherwiſe the time will come when we ſhall be
grieuouſly puniſhed. But with what wordes did the Angell ſpeake vnto the
ſhepeheards? the Euangeliſt ſayth after this ſort:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Angell ſayd vnto them: Be not afraid: for behold,
I bring you glad tidings of great ioy, that shall be to all people, that is,
that vnto you is borne this day in the citie of Dauid, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, vvhich is
Chriſt the Lord. And this shall be a ſigne to you: Ye shall find the babe
ſvvadled, and layd in a maunger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learne by theſe wordes of the Angell, how to vſe rightly the
natiuitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Chriſt, neither let it ſuffice you to heare them
onely. A great treaſure hidden in the earth or ſome other where, is to no
vſe, but if it be opened, and occupied, then is it profitable and precious.
Wherefore giue heede hereunto, that thou mayſt vſe this natiuitie,
otherwiſe it ſhal be no commoditie and comfort <pb n="9" facs="tcp:9413:13"/> vnto
thee. For whereas thou knoweſt the bare hiſtorie onely, to witte, what came
to paſſe in his natiuitie, and that he was borne needy and poore, thou
ſhalt take no greater commoditie hereby, then if thou heare a hiſtorie
written of the king of Fraunce, or of ſome other puiſſant Prince, whereby
no commoditie or comfort ſhould come vnto thee.</p>
               <p>But how muſt we vſe this natiuitie rightly and with
frute?<note place="margin">
                     <p>What it is to vſe the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of chriſt aright.</p> 
                     <p>Our owne natiuitie of what ſort it is.</p>
                  </note> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as
I haue ſayd, if we be thus perſwaded that he was borne for vs, that his
natiuitie is ours. Our natiuitie is ſuch, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together aboundeth with
ſinne, as Dauid ſayth Pſal. 51: <hi>Behold I was shapen in wickednes,
&amp; in ſinne hath my mother concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me.</hi> As if he would ſay: here
is nothing but ſinne, as well in the conception as in the birth, whatſoeuer
I bring with me from my mothers wombe, it is wholly damnable, it is due to
death, Satan, &amp; hell. Foraſmuch then as our natiuitie, ſkin &amp; heare
are defiled, what good can come therof? This is our title which we haue
receiued from Adam, in this one thing we may glory and in nothing elſe at
all, namely, that euery infant that is borne into this world, is wholy in the
power of ſinne, death, Satan, hel, and eternall damnation: our natiuitie is
altogether miſerable, and on euery ſide to be lamented. To deliuer vs from
this natiuitie, God ſent an other natiuitie, which it behoued to be pure
&amp; without all ſpot, that it might make this vncleane &amp; ſinnefull
natiuitie pure. This is that natiuitie of the Lorde Chriſt his onely begotten
ſonne.<note place="margin">The natiuity of Chriſt.</note> Wherefore he woulde
not haue him borne of fleſh &amp; blood infected with ſynne, but it behoued
that he ſhoulde be borne of a pure Virgine. He ſuffered no ſpot at all or
ſinne in his fleſh, but repleniſhed it with the holy Ghoſt, &amp;
permitted nothing to ſticke therein, but thoſe miſeries which proceede of
fleſh and blood, as hunger, thirſt, aduerſitie, and death, ſinne
excepted, as the Epiſtle to the Heb. chap. 4. witneſſeth, <hi>that he was
in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne.</hi> This is that
moſt excellent thing, which the Lord our God hath done for vs, whereof none
taketh any frute, but he that beleeueth. And none will eaſily beleeue this,
but he that feeleth of what ſorte his owne natiuitie is. He that hath no
feeling of his owne miſerie, taſteth not of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of Chriſt.
But if we feele our miſerie, it followeth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that we cry with the
Prophet Dauid and ſay: <hi>Behold I was shapen in wickednes, and in ſinne
hath my mother conceiued <pb n="10" facs="tcp:9413:14"/> me:</hi> for we feele our ſinne
and our euill natiuitie.</p>
               <p>When death ſhall come vpon vs, and our heart ſhalbe touched
with anguiſh &amp; grief, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the laſt it may be, that we would caſt
of this happy &amp; pure natiuitie, and will excedingly thirſt after it to
enioy it. But now when as we feele not our ſinnes, neither doe as yet taſt
of the bitternes of ſinne, it ſtideth coldly to the hart, we heare it in
deede, but truely it doth not throughly enter vnto the hart. For if a man did
beleue, that this natiuitie was for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, he would feare neither
ſinne, nor death. Wherefore I haue ſayd that a Chriſtian muſt beleeue,
and dout nothing, that the natiuitie of Chriſt is as well his, as it is the
Lord Chriſtes. And as he hath of the virgin pure blood and fleſh, ſo that
he him ſelfe alſo is pure, and that this virgin is his mother
ſpiritually, as ſhe was the mother of Chriſt carnally. Let the hart haue
ſure confidence in this perſwaſion, otherwiſe it will be in an euil
caſe. This the Angell ſignifieth in theſe wordes when he ſayth: Vnto
you he is borne,<note place="margin">Chriſt is borne vnto vs, and is made wholy
ours.</note> as if he ſayd, what ſoeuer he is and hath, ye may chalenge it
to your ſelues. Alſo he is your Sauiour, not that ye ſhould onely looke
vppon him, but which is able to deliuer you from the tyrannie of ſinne,
death, Satan, and all euell: yea and how great ſoeuer he be, he is borne vnto
you, and is yours with all that he hath. Nowe foraſmuch as he is myne, and
hath chaunged his natiuitie into myne, his fleſh &amp; blood alſo is myne,
he him ſelfe is myne with all wherewith he is endued, ſo that I dare ſaye
vnto his mother: Beholde, that child which thou haſt brought forth, is mine,
his fleſh and blood are my fleſh and blood, yea and thou art my mother, and
I will be counted of thee for thy ſonne, for whatſoeuer Chriſt bringeth
with him, it muſt be myne, euen as he himſelfe is myne. If ſo be that his
natiuitie be myne, being of a virgin, and without ſynne, repleniſhed with
the holy Ghoſt, my natiuitie alſo muſt be of a virgin, and pure from
ſynne.</p>
               <p>Here now Eue the firſt mother is no more my mother, for it
muſt needes be that that natiuitie doe vtterly die and periſh, that there
may be no ſinne remayning. Here this mother Marie is to be ſet againſt
that mother, of whome I was borne in ſinne. And thus the Angel bringeth with
him great ioy, for it can not be, but that the hart ſhould be made glad, when
it enioyeth this Sauiour as his owne. When we come to hand ſtrokes, that is,
when we <pb n="11" facs="tcp:9413:14"/> feele our miſerie and calamitie, there remayneth
no comfort or helpe, then my hart can not lift it ſelfe aboue the heauy
burden, wherewith it is preſſed downe, but it muſt needes faint and be
diſcouraged. But if I conceiue a truſt, and doute nothing that Chriſts
natiuitie is mine, that my ſinnes be taken away by him. I become exceding
ioyfull, &amp; am confirmed with comfort, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all heauines and ſorrow is
ſhaken of.<note place="margin">True com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ioy.</note> This onely is that
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and no other, which maketh a good conſcience, which fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
neither death nor hell, for it alwayes reſteth vpon the word of God, which
giueth Chriſt vnto vs. Wherefore it is a thinge altogether miſerable and
lamentable, if ſuch a good conſcience be ſought in any other thinges then
here. Thou ſhalt find no ioy, no peace of conſcience, neither in heauen,
nor in earth, but in this Chriſt, be thou certaine and ſure thereof.
Wherefore let all other thinges paſſe, and cleaue vnto him onely, if thou
deſire to be bold and couragious againſt ſinne, death, the deuill, hell,
&amp; all thinges that are againſt thee. He is the Lorde &amp; Sauiour. Ye
vnderſtand I truſt, this right wel, foraſmuch as ye haue now heard it
ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But I doe with ſo great earneſtnes as it were beate it into
your mindes, that ye may ſee, that there is but one thing taught in the whole
Scripture, which I would haue to ſticke firmely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutedly in you, this
is that which I haue ſayd, that the vſe of this natiuitie be knowne.</p>
               <p>They which ſeeke any other thing, and vſe not this
natiuitie, are in a deſperat caſe, as ye haue heard. Which ye haue very wel
expreſſed in this ſonge, the author whereof whoſoeuer he was, did
nothing erre from the purpoſe, to witte, that the onely childe Chriſt is
our comfort. Which wordes ſurely are of very great importance, and deſerue
moſt diligently to be weyed. For ye did ſing after this ſort: A child
highly to be prayſed is borne vnto vs this day of a chaſt virgin, to the
comfort of vs wretches. If that child had not bin borne, we had periſhed all.
Is it not ſayd here, that there is no comfort beſide only Chriſt? which
in deed is moſt true. Without dout the holy Ghoſt taught him that made this
ſong to ſinge after this ſort. If the caſe ſtand thus, it followeth
that Monkes, Nunnes, Sacrificing Prieſtes, and all which leaue this child,
and ſeeke to come to heauen by other wayes and works, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned. For
ſuch ſay that they neede not this child, otherwiſe they woulde
confeſſe, that their owne workes be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <pb n="12" facs="tcp:9413:15"/> worth.
Theſe therefore do nothing but deceiue and ſeduce, of whom mens harts are
procured to depart from Chriſt, and are led away vnto Satan. In the
aforeſayd ſong is contayned more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer: He is the ſaluation of vs all, oh
ſweete Ieſu Chriſt, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thou art borne man, defende vs from
hell. I greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that ye did well vnderſtand this. It is ſoong
abroade euery where, but there is none that throughly beleueth it. Whereupon it
commeth that ſome doe oppugne theſe things, eſpecially they, which know,
ſing, and babble very much of them, that truely I feare, that Chriſt is
neuer more blaſphemed, then at this feaſt of his natiuitie, and at other
great feaſtes, that it ſhould be no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, if, when he is ſo
blaſphemed, he ſhould ſuffer the whole world to be ſwallowed vp: but
the laſt day is at hand. Wherefore ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that ye may ſound this
excellent ſong in your hart, and as ye ſing it in mouth, ſo ye may alſo
beleue it.</p>
               <p>If the caſe ſtande thus, that all thinges without this child
are vaine,<note place="margin">No meanes but by Chriſt to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heauen.</note> what neede is there then of much buſines? why dooſt thou
runne this way &amp; that way, and endeuoreſt to do workes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou
mayſt prepare thee a ſeate in heauen? which they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially doe, that
murmure vp many Roſaries, and doe continually extoll the mother of God in
mouth onely, but in hart thinke more euil of her then of all others: &amp; not
onely of her, but of Chriſt him ſelfe alſo the Lord and Sauiour.
Wherefore commit this ſo to memorie, that ye may be certainly perſwaded,
that whatſoeuer dependeth of any other then of that child, it is all
damnable, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Angell had lyed. This muſt be compted for moſt
certaine without any addition, neither are theſe trifles to be wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to
witte, that this ſufficeth not that thou dooſt beleeue, moe thinges are to
be added. Foraſmuch then as the Angell ſayth, that this child doth all, and
that he is the Sauiour, and if he be not, that all labour is loſt, tell me,
how can it follow, that ſome thing is to be done of thee, when it is already
done before? Dooſt thou goe about to doe any thinge that thou mayſt obtaine
him? That child ſuffereth not him ſelfe to be apprehended and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by
workes, for albeit thou heape together workes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thou dooſt
not yet enioy the child. Moreouer thy works be vncleane, by which ſuch a
great treaſure can not be gotten, no though they were euen holy. But he is to
be apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in hart, ſo that thou beleeue, and ſay to the Angel: I
beleeue that it is true <pb n="13" facs="tcp:9413:15"/> which thou ſayeſt, and nothing
at all douting I count this childe for a Sauiour borne vnto me. And this part
wherof we haue now ſpoken, pertaineth to faith.</p>
               <p>Now we haue here alſo an other part pertayning to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
life, namely charitie, that workes may not be reiected. If thou wilt doe
workes, doe them not in that reſpect, that thou perſwade thy ſelfe that
thou dooſt obtayne any thing of God by them.<note place="margin">A moſt
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to be followed of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in doing of good
workes.</note> But follow this example: ſuch a one as Chriſt hath ſhewed
him ſelfe to thee be thou alſo towarde thy neighbour. If thou doe more
nearely conſider the example of Chriſt, thou ſhalt finde nothing but
meere loue. Whereas he humbleth him ſelfe and is borne in ſo great
pouertie, that declareth nothing, but loue toward thee, which moued him to
become a ſeruaunt for thy ſake, as Paule Philip. 2. ſayth, who knew that
he might remayne in diuine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now this he did for thy commoditie, he bowed
his eies to thy miſerie and calamitie, which art ſo miſerable a man,
wholy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable &amp; abounding with ſinne, thy natiuitie is vncleane, thy
miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is on euery ſide moſt great, thou haſt deſerued nothing but
the wrath of God &amp; eternall damnation. If thou hadſt bene a Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
Monke a thowſand yeares, thou couldeſt not deliuer thy ſelf from this
miſerye and damnation. But Chriſt is able to helpe thee, he is rich and
hath ſtrength ſufficient: ſeeing therefore he can doe ſuch thinges, he
doth them willingly and with pleaſure. Loue enforceth him ſo farre, that he
employeth all thinges for thy ſake, and beſtoweth whatſoeuer he hath for
thee. Foraſmuch then as Chriſt ſheweth ſo great loue toward thee, and
giueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee whatſoeuer he is able, do thou likewiſe to thy neighbour.
Wilt thou worke workes? deriue them to thy neighbour, who is compaſſed with
troubles &amp; miſeries. Thou muſt doe nothing for this cauſe, that
Chriſt hath neede thereof, whereby thou maiſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich him, for neither was
he bountiful to this ende, that he might any thing profit his father thereby,
or that he might receiue any commoditie of him, but he did it onely for this
cauſe, that therein the father might be well pleaſed, inaſmuch as he
ſubmitteth him ſelfe wholy to his fathers will, and loueth vs with ſo
great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
               <p>After the ſame ſort we alſo muſt doe in our works toward
our neighbour, which we ought therefore onely to doe, that we may giue thanks
to the father, that he ſheweth his fauour vnto vs, for <pb n="14" facs="tcp:9413:16"/>
that he hath giuen his beloued ſonne vnto me, to beſtow vpon me
whatſoeuer he hath. When I beleue this vndoutedly, I burſt forth and ſay:
If God ſheweth vnto me ſo great benefits and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in his beloued
ſonne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſuffereth him to beſtow all things vpon me, I alſo will
doe the like againe, and beſtow all thinges whereby I may doe good to my
neighbour and loue him. And ſo I doe not lift vp myne eyes vnto heauen, but I
go thether, where my neighbour is oppreſſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aduerſitie, pouertie,
ſicknes, ſinne, or errour, and I helpe him wherein ſoeuer I am able. Thus
doe thou whoſoeuer thou art, which mindeſt to do true good works: as thou
wouldeſt haue done to thy ſelfe, if thou were troubled with pouertie, ſo
doe thou to thy neighbour being poore. Againe, if thy neighbour be a ſinner,
and thou ſeeſt it, but thou thy ſelf art without ſinne, and haſt a
holy natiuitie, goe, preach vnto him, whereby he alſo may be deliuered. But
thou muſt doe all theſe things freely in euery reſpect, as Chriſt hath
done for thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all workes and merits, of pure grace, loue, and mercy.
Such workes ſee thou doe, if thou wilt doe good and Chriſtian workes in
deede. God hath no neede of them, neuertheles thou muſt doe them in reſpect
of him, inaſmuch as it ſo pleaſeth him, and he will haue it to be ſo.
This onely is rightly to doe good workes, which thoſe hypocrites do not,
which will merit heauen by their chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pouertie, &amp; obedience. Vnto
whom I pray you are ſuch works of theirs good? I my ſelfe neede them not,
neither doe they profit my neighbour, wherefore it is mere deceit, whereas a
name is giuen to workes as though they did merit heauen, when as they are
nothing worth, neither profitable to others. Laye vppe theſe thinges in your
hartes, and do alſo according to them. In all this text being diſcuſſed
from the beginning to the ending, ye haue theſe two thinges, namely faith and
loue. If ye ſhall keepe theſe, then both the holy natiuitie of Chriſt
ſhall be a helpe, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and comfort vnto you, and alſo ye ſhall be
ſpiritually the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his mother, as Chriſt Ieſus is her childe
carnally.</p>
               <div n="song of angels" type="part">
                  <head>An expoſition of the ſong of the Angells, <hi>Glory be
to God on high, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Glory be to God on high, and in earth peace, good will
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi> Foraſmuch as this ſong is very common, and there be fewe
that rightly vnderſtande it, when as notwithſtanding it <pb n="15" facs="tcp:9413:16"/> contayneth many thinges in it, I thinke good to handle it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
at large. The Angells in this hymne apply three things to three: glory to God,
peace to the earth, and good will vnto men. The firſt is the honour or glory
of God,<note place="margin">Glory due to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> with which we muſt
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, that in all thinges prayſe and glory may be aſſcribed to God,
as to him which doeth, giueth, and hath all thinges, ſo that none may
chalenge any good thing at all vnto him ſelfe, neither ought to count it his
owne. Glory is ſo due to God onely, that no part therof may be deriued to any
other. Adam being perſwaded of Satan, went about to take this glory to him
ſelfe, whereby all men fell into the diſpleaſure of God, &amp; haue that
vice ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed in their mind, that no other thing can be ſo
hardly pluckt away from them. Euery man pleaſeth him ſelfe, no man can
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to ſeeme that he is nothing, or is able to doe nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of come
almoſt all euills, ſo many contentions, warres, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other
diſcommodities. This glory Chriſt gaue to God his father, teaching that all
our thinges are nothing before God but ſinnes, which deſerue his wrath and
indignation, and nothing leſſe then glory. Wherfore there is no cauſe,
that we ſhould euen neuer ſo litle pleaſe our ſelues or glory in them,
but rather that we ſhould be aſhamed and feare, being ſet in ſo great
perill and confuſion, that ſo all our glory and pleaſing of our ſelues
may paſſe away and come to nothing, and we may reioyce being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of our owne glorie, that we may be found &amp; ſaued in Chriſt alone.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is peace in earth. For,<note place="margin">Where
true peace is, and where it is not.</note> as where the glory of God is not,
and where euery one ſeeketh his owne glory, there can not be peace, according
as Salomon ſayth Prouerb. 13. <hi>Among the proude there is euer
ſtrife:</hi> ſo contrariwiſe, where the glory of God is knowne, there
true peace alſo muſt needes be. For why ſhould they contend? why ſhould
they diſagree, which doe know euery one of them, that they haue no good thing
of their owne, but that all thinges which are, which they haue, and which they
are able to doe, come from God, to whoſe power alſo they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all
thinges, they in the meane ſeaſon being very wel content, that they haue
God fauorable vnto them? Howe alſo can it be, that when one counteth nothing
of him ſelfe and the thinges that be his, he ſhould be ſo carefull of him
ſelfe and his thinges, that he ſhould moue contention with any becauſe of
them? Such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <pb n="16" facs="tcp:9413:17"/> that Chriſt onely is made all
thinges vnto them, him they thinke on, and for him alone they contend. Hereupon
it certainly followeth, that there can be no contention or diſcord at al
among true Chriſtians:<note place="margin">The peace of Chriſtians
deſcribed by Eſai. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 11.9.</note> which maner of peace of
Chriſtians Eſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, &amp; ſayth: <hi>No man shall doe euill vnto
an other, no man shall deſtroy an other in my holy hill,</hi> that is, in the
Church of Chriſt. The cauſe hereof he addeth next after: <hi>The earth is
full of the knowledge of God,</hi> that is, for all know God, as to whom all
good thinges doe belong, and all their owne things they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be
nothing but ſinnes, they may eaſily therefore haue peace among them
ſelues.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſai.</hi> 2.4.</note> Wherefore the ſame
Eſay ſayth in an other place: <hi>They shall breake their ſwordes into
mattocks, &amp; their ſpeares to make ſythes, and one shall not lift vp a
weapon againſt an other, neither shall they learne ro fight from thence
forth.</hi> Hereupon Chriſt is called the king of peace, or the prince of
peace, of whom Salomon was a figure, who is called peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For Chriſt is
truly called our king Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which hath reſtored peace
vnto vs inwardly with God through faith in him, and outwardly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our
neighbours through loue, whereby we liue friendly with all men: and ſo by him
we haue peace euery where both inwardly, and outwardly in the earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Good will.</note>The third is good will of
men. Not that good will, whereby we worke good workes, but whereby we take in
good part all thinges that happen, whether they be good or euill, ſweete or
ſower, and do receiue them with a quiet hart. The Angells knew that the peace
which they did ſing of, ſhould be only among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which in all
thinges doe depend vpon Chriſt, and vſurpe nothing to them ſelues as
their owne. But in the meane ſeaſon the world and Satan, which doe
exceedingly enuie them, doe on euery ſide procure trouble vnto them, and
perſecute them euen vnto the death, ſo that they may looke for no peace or
quietnes at all of theſe, for Chriſt ſayth Ioh. 16. <hi>In me ye shall
haue peace, but in the world ye shall haue affliction.</hi> Therefore it was
not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Angells to haue ſoong, <hi>peace in earth,</hi> but it
was to be added: <hi>and good will towardes men,</hi> that when they, as much
as they are able, haue peace with all men, and neuertheles are continually
hated of all men, and doe ſuffer perſecution, they may alwaies keepe a good
wil, wherby they may take all things <pb n="17" facs="tcp:9413:17"/> in good parte, and
giue thankes to God,<note place="margin">Chriſtians muſt beare perſecution
and trouble patiently.</note> howeſoeuer he dealeth with them, or ſuffereth
them to be dealt with, they may not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, but reſigne and commit them
ſelues wholy to the will of God, yea (foraſmuch as they knowe that God doth
diſpoſe &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne all thinges, whom they are ſure, that they haue a
mercifull and moſt fauorable father vnto them through Chriſt) they may euen
reioyce &amp; be glad in perſecutions, according to that ſaying of Paule in
the Epiſtle to the Romanes: <hi>VVe reioyce in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and
perſecutions.</hi> For inaſmuch as they haue a ioyfull conſcience and a
ſure truſt of the fauour of God, they can not but count all thinges for the
beſt, whatſoeuer happen.</p>
                  <p>Behold what kinde of good will it is in all thinges, whether
they be proſperous or vnproſperous, which the Angells doe here wiſh vnto
men, &amp; ſing to be propper to the beleuers.<note place="margin">Where good
will is not, there peace can not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</note> Where ſuch good will is
wanting, there peace can not long be. Men take all thinges in the worſe part,
they take nothing in good part, but do alwayes increaſe and double the euil.
Hereupon howſoeuer God dealeth with them, they like it not, but require that
they may be dealt otherwiſe with, and ſo it falleth out as it is in Pſal.
18. <hi>with the pure thou shalt be pure, and with the froward thou shalt be
froward,</hi> that is, with him that counteth all thinges pure to him ſelfe,
and hath that good will in all thinges, whereof we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, thou alſo
dooſt well agree, inaſmuch as he pleaſeth thee and all good men. But he
that is froward, ſo that neither thou, nor thoſe thinges that are thine doe
like him, can not but diſpleaſe both thee and all good men. Of this well
pleaſing one an other Paule ſpeaketh 1. Cor. 10. <hi>Endeuour to pleaſe
all men, euen as I pleaſe all.</hi> By what meanes ſhall this be done? If
thou take all thinges in good part, and ſuffer others to pleaſe thee, thou
alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſhalt pleaſe others. The matter may be comprehended in one
word: If thou wilt be liked of none, nothing ſhall be liked of thee: If thou
wilt be liked of all,<note place="margin">How farre we may pleaſe men and
ſubmit our ſelues vnto them.</note> ſuffer that all thinges may be
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo liked of thee, but ſo, that thou doe not neglect the worde of the
Lord. For that ought to be preferred before all, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had of all
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what pleaſeth them, or what diſpleaſeth them. But whatſoeuer may
be done without tranſgreſſing the word of God, giue place to all, &amp;
ſubmit thy iudgement to the iudgement of others, that thou mayſt take euery
thing in good part, which ſhall chaunce vnto thee, &amp; ſo thou ſhalt
haue the good wil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <pb n="18" facs="tcp:9413:18"/> the Angells did ſing.</p>
                  <p>By this ſong it may be vnderſtood, what nature the Angells
haue. I omit thoſe thinges which the Philoſophers haue drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hereof:
here is ſo deſcribed what the Angells are, that it can not be more fully
done, their hart and cogitations being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.<note place="margin">The firſt
thing to be conſidered in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.</note> Firſt with great ioy they
ſing prayſes to God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging all thinges to be due vnto him, and
therefore doe with an ardent mind, and ſinging glorifie him. As therefore
thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thinke of a right lowly, pure, and obedient hart, prayſing
God, and alwayes enioying perpetuall gladnes in him, ſo thinke alſo of the
Angells: and thou haſt now the nature of Angells, as much as they haue to doe
with God.<note place="margin">The ſecond thing which we ought to marke in the
Angells.</note> The ſecond thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in them is their loue
towardes vs. Thinke that they are moſt louing toward vs, which deſire that
it may goe as well with vs as with them ſelues, they doe no leſſe reioyce
for our ſafetie then for their owne, &amp; euen in this hymne full of loue to
vs ward, they declare them ſelues ſo affected toward vs, that ſurely, we
may thinke and reioyce of them, as of moſt louing friends. This is to knowe
the Angells truely, not according to their eſſence, whereof the
Philoſophers doe fooliſhly &amp; without frute babble many thinges, but
according to their hart and mind, ſo that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I know not, what their
nature is in it ſelfe, yet I know what is their chiefe deſire, and their

               <p>After therfore that theſe wiſe men had found the child

yeares, &amp; opened their treaſures before him, offering vnto him golde,
frankincenſe and myrrhe. Wherein againe we ought to marke the nature of
faith, that it is offended at nothing, but cleaueth to the word onely, and
nothing eſteemeth thoſe thinges that ſhine outwardly. Theſe wiſe men
doe not therefore diſdayne neither turne backe, becauſe the child together
with his parents were without all pompe in pouertie and miſerie, and nothing
leſſe then a kingly child appeareth vnto them, but they goe on, and
vndoutedly acknowledge him for a king, as they had learned concerning him out
of the Scriptures. Moreouer they giue vnto him the honour meete for a king,
they offer moſt precious gifts, which they had brought, being euen of the

would haue done no ſuch thing, but according to the maner thereof, would haue
looked for gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of purple, and reſort of ſeruaunts, and handmaydens.

exerciſed in theſe, and faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy guide, ſhalt endeuour rightly to
apply thy ſelf vnto them, then other workes which haue a fayre ſhewe, as to
inſtitute maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to be occupied in vigils and yeares mindes, to build
temples, and ſuch like follies, ſhal by them ſelues be pluckt out of thy
hart &amp; vaniſh away, vnto which workes, ſurely now almoſt the whole
world is addicted: they are in deede fayre in the very outwarde ſhew, and
ſeeme to be very precious, when as notwithſtanding they are an abhomination
vnto God. But whatſoeuer God hath commaunded, as to doe good to our
neighbour, and to be touched with his aduerſities no leſſe then with our
own, to beare a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well willing minde toward him, theſe are
neglected, and in the eyes of the world appeare trifling and fooliſh:
whereupon we doe greatly abhorre them. How commeth this to paſſe? Euen
therefore, becauſe they haue no goodly ſhew outwardly. And the common
people of Germanie are wont to ſay: That which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, or hath not a
fayre ſhew, is nothing ſet by.</p>
               <p>Moreouer God doth ſooner ſuffer him ſelfe to lacke his
owne honour and due ſeruice, then that he woulde haue vs to leaue of from
doing our dutie toward our neighbour, as Chriſt witneſſeth 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9413:20"/> Matth. 5. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the
altar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God doth not accept the ſeruice which we offer
him, if we neglect charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our neighbour.</note> 
                  <hi>and there
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leaue there thine
offering before the altar, and goe thy way: firſt be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come, and offer thy gift.</hi> Here ye doe moſt plainly
both heare and ſee, that God will not be ſerued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les we firſt goe to
our neighbour, and be reconciled to him. For the ſame cauſe alſo God
reiecteth the ſacrifices of the Iewes, as it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Propheſie of Eſay
chap. 1 for that they did neglect thoſe thinges which were more
neceſſary, namely mercy and faith: for thus he ſayth: <hi>VVhy offer ye
ſo many ſacrifices vnto me? I am ful of the burnt offerings of weathers,
&amp; of the fat of fed beaſts, I haue no pleaſure in the blood of
bullocks, lammes, &amp; goates. VVhen ye come to appeare before me treading in
my courts, who hath required this at your handes? Offer me no mo obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for it is but loſt labour: incenſe is an abhominable thing vnto me. I may
not away with your newe moones, your ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes, &amp; ſolemne meetings,
your ſolemne aſſemblies are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. I hate your new moones and appointed
feaſtes euen from my very hart, they make me weary, I can not abide them.
VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye hold out your handes, I will turne mine eyes from you: and though ye
make many prayers, yet I will heare nothing at all, ſeeing your handes are
full of blood. VVashe you, make you cleane, put away your euil thoughts out of
my ſight, ceaſe from doing of euill. Learne to doe well, apply your
ſelues to equitie, deliuer the oppreſſed, helpe the fatherles to his
right, defend the widow,</hi> &amp; ſo forth as is there rehearſed of
Eſay. By theſe words of Eſay ye ſee what God requireth, &amp; what he
alloweth. When we neglect thoſe workes, by which our neighbour is ſerued,
he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine will neglect vs. For whatſoeuer benefit we beſtow vppon our
neighbour, that we beſtow vppon God and Chriſt him ſelfe, as he ſhall
pronounce in the laſt iudgement:<note place="margin">

banners? Are not all thinges mine firſt? Heauen is my ſeate, and the earth

I haue ſet liuing temples before thee, theſe are to be edified,

               <p>Here therefore let vs learne, how the wiſe men did nothing

Wherefore Chriſt ſayd to his diſciples, when he ſent them forth to

&amp; prieſts, not at Hieruſalem, in ſo noble and famous a city, but at
Bethlehem in a ſtable, with poore and deſpiſed creatures, namely Ioſeph
and Marie. In a ſumme, Chriſt will there be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, where a man would
leaſt ſeeke for him.</p>
               <p>But we muſt diligently conſider alſo, what theſe wiſe
men ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by their giftes.<note place="margin">What the wiſe men
ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nified by their offring of gold.</note> For aſſuredly they ſhewed
by them, that this child is a king, and not a king onely, but alſo God, and
man. In offering gold they acknowledged him for a king, as if they would ſay:
We bring vnto thee gold, not that we would thereby enrich thee. For gold,
ſiluer, and whatſoeuer is made is thine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:9413:21"/> but
hereby we acknowledge thee to be a moſt mighty king ouer all thinges. So we
alſo offer gold vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">How &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we offer gold
vnto Chriſt.</note> when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for our king and Lord: but vnto
this is required a very ſtronge faith. For if I ought to acknowledge him for
my king and Lord, all mine owne will muſt be extinguiſhed, that it reigne
nothing at all in me: for Chriſt onely muſt reigne &amp; rule in me, that
he may doe whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him in me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, all
thinges muſt be committed vnto him. So the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Matthew did, which
ſayd vnto Chriſt: <hi>Lord, if thou vvilt thou canſt make me cleane.</hi>
Therefore my will muſt be vtterly extinguiſhed in me, if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I will haue
Chriſt to reigne in me. Chriſt alſo ſuffered not his owne will to rule,
but he alwayes ſubmitted him ſelfe to the will of his father, which he
teſtifieth in the ſixt chapter of the Goſpell by S. Iohn: <hi>I came
dovvne from heauen, not to doe mine ovvne vvill, but his vvill vvhich hath
ſent me.</hi> Yea he obeyed his father euen vnto death, and ſubmitted him
ſelfe wholy to his will. We imitating this example, which is written for our
ſingular conſolation, ought to ſubmit our will to God and his Chriſt,
and to reſt confidently vpon him. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth howe to bringe the matter
notably well to paſſe, as it is ſayd Pſal. 37. <hi>Commit thy vvay vnto
God, and put thy truſt in him, and he shall bringe it to paſſe.</hi> And
a litle after: <hi>Hold thee ſtill in God, and ſuffer him to vvorke vvith
thee.</hi> Such ſentences ought to prouoke vs, patiently to ſuffer the will
of God in vs, whether ſweete thinges or ſowre, commodities or
diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come vnto vs: for he knoweth with what temperature to lay
them vpon vs. Bleſſed is he that beleueth theſe thinges from his hart.
Who being ſuch a one, can be troubled with ſorow? Such a man howſoeuer he
be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, whether he be burned or drowned, caſt into priſon, or
otherwiſe grieuouſly delt with, he taketh all in good part. For he knoweth
that theſe thinges ſhall turne to his commoditie. After this ſort doe we
alſo offer golde with the wiſe men, when we take away rule from our owne
will, and do ſuffer Chriſt to worke in vs accordinge to his will &amp;
pleaſure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are hypocrites, which knowe not to ſuffer the
will of God, but howſoeuer he dealeth with them, haue alwayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they
doe complayne. They forſooth ſuppoſe, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they thinke, it
ſhall haue ſucceſſe according to their thinking, If it fall out
otherwiſe, they are angrie, they do not patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9413:22"/> perſecution and contempt: they murmure, they finde
fault, and vexe when thoſe thinges happen, no otherwiſe then horſes being
ſtirred vp with furie or rage. So therfore by reſiſting they ſtaye the
kingdome of Chriſt from them, and depriue Chriſt of gold, which
notwithſtanding they ought to offer and preſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that is, they
them ſelues will beare rule, &amp; doe not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to acknowledge
Chriſt for their king and Lord.</p>

diuine honour, which we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offer vnto him, when we confeſſe, that
whatſoeuer we haue, we muſt acknowledge it to haue come from God, and that
we haue it freely, and without any merit of ours: Wherefore all theſe thinges
are to be aſcribed vnto him, as to the true Lord, neither muſt we glorie
one whitte in the good thinges receiued, but his glorie is to be ſought in
them. And if he take them from vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, we ought to ſuffer him with quiet
mindes, and to bleſſe him with the beloued Iob in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21.</note>

ſuffer all misfortunes and aduerſities, as if God him ſelfe did caſt
them vppon our necke, ſo that none ſhall be able to offende vs, vnles he
take away Chriſt from vs. Not ſo muche as a heare of our heades ſhal
periſh, as Chriſt ſayth to his Diſciples Luke 21. Wherefore
whatſoeuer ſhal moleſt vs, what aduerſity ſoeuer ſhal come vnto vs,
we ought neuer to ſeeke any other God, we ought no where to ſeeke any
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe and comfort, then of Chriſt alone. This is he which is made vnto
vs of God the father, wiſedom, righteouſnes, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and
redemption. Then onely we offer vnto Chriſt that right frankincenſe of
Arabia, when we flie vnto him alone in our calamities, afflictions, and
anguiſhes. But they that ſeeke after ſtraunge helpes and comforts, as of
Sorcerers, Witches, and ſuch like, they doe not offer frankincenſe vnto
Chriſt, but ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king brimſtone, wherein they ſhall be burned for euer,
for that they haue not beleued and truſted in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Myrrhe what it ſignified.</note>By myrrhe
they ſignified a mortall man: for with myrrhe dead bodies were anointed, that
for certaine yeares they ſhould not putrifie. Now myrrhe is a ſtronge and
bitter iuice, which diſtilleth from the trees of Arabia, like vnto gumme, or
as with vs roſen iſſueth out of the pine tree, the firre tree, &amp;c.
But then <pb n="27" facs="tcp:9413:22"/> we offer myrrhe vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">When we offer myrrhe vnto Chriſt.</note> when we firmely beleeue
that he by his death hath ouercome ſinne, Satan and hell. And this is a
ſpeciall faith. If we doe but a litle dout here, it is not well with vs. But
if I beleue from my hart, that death, ſinne, the deuill, and hell are
ſwallowed vp in and by the death of Chriſt, I ſhall not be afraid of them
all. I ſhall eaſily be preſerued from rottennes which death bringeth,
when I haue myrrhe, that is, the death of my Lord Chriſt in my body and
ſoule, this will not ſuffer me to periſh. So ſtronge and valiant a
thing is faith, vnto which euen all thinges are poſſible, as Chriſt
ſayth Mar. 9. Here muſt we learne daily with our Lord Chriſt to bring
vnder our old Adam, and to mortifie his concupiſcences, by the croſſe,
and tentations, not that croſſe which we doe choſe, but which Chriſt
layeth on vs, let vs beare it patiently and with a willing mind, that ſo our
body may be ſubdued, and made ſubiect to the ſpirit, that being ſo
buried with Chriſt through baptiſme, we may be rayſed vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with
him, and he alone may reigne and liue in vs. Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſighing is
required, which the holy Ghoſt doth make in vs for our ſake, as Paule
ſayth Rom. 8. that Chriſt will helpe vs, to keepe vnder this vnruly and
obſtinate fleſh, that it preſume not too licentiouſly, &amp; thruſt
the noble ſoule into the myre. This our baptiſme doth ſignifie, to wit,
no other thing then that that olde and ſtinking Adam be mortified, and
buried, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ought to reuolue in our minde, ſeeing that as long
as we liue here, ſinnes doe remayne in vs. Wherefore alwayes ſome thing
muſt be repayred in vs without all intermiſſion, through the cogitation
of baptiſme, as it were in a houſe decayed through oldnes, euen vntill
ſuch time as we depart this life. Whereof S. Paule entreateth in very goodly
wordes Rom. 6. which are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be marked of vs, now he ſayth thus:
<hi>Knovv ye not that all vve, vvhich haue bene baptized into Ieſus Chriſt,
haue bene baptized into his death? VVe are buried then with him by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme
into his death, that like as Chriſt vvas raiſed vp from the dead to the
glorie of the Father, ſo vve alſo shoulde vvalke in nevvnes of life. For if
vve be planted vvith him, to the ſimilitude of his death: euen ſo shall vve
be to the ſimilitude of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, knovving this, that our old man
is crucified vvith him, that the bodie of ſinne might be deſtroyed, that
henceforth vve should not ſerue ſinne. For he that is dead, is freed from
ſinne. <pb n="28" facs="tcp:9413:23"/> VVherefore, if we be dead with Chriſt, we
beleue that we shal liue alſo with him, knovving that Chriſt being rayſed
from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more dominion ouer him. For in that
he died, he died once to ſinne, but in that he liueth, he liueth to God.
Likevviſe thinke ye alſo that ye are dead to ſinne, but are aliue to God
in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Thus much concerning the firſt
appearance.</p>
               <p>Now we will ſpeake ſomewhat of the ſecond, that is of the
ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Three thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in
Chriſtes Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme.</note> In the baptiſme of Chriſt three thinges are
to be conſidered: The firſt, that the heauens were opened, when he was
baptized. The ſeconde, that the holy Ghoſt was ſeene in the likenes of a
doue. The third, that the voice of the father was heard, which ſayd: <hi>This
is my beloued ſonne, in vvhome I am vvell pleaſed.</hi> Whereas Chriſt
vouchſaued to be baptiſed with water, he hath hallowed baptiſme, &amp;
made the water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of holy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which is baptized in his name, might
become like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe holy and cleane from ſinne, and might haue the heauens
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Now Chriſt was not baptized for him ſelfe, for he was not infected
with the ſpot of any ſinne, as S. Peter ſayth 1. Pet. 2. He behaued him
ſelfe like vnto a good Phiſitian, which before the ſicke doth firſt
drinke ſome bitter potion, that the ſicke may more gladly and boldly doe
the ſame afterward. For we in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme drinke a bitter potion, namely, the
mortification of the olde Adam, which with the bitternes thereof doth greatly
trouble vs. For that dipping into the water or ſprinkling with it doth
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing els, but that that old Adam ſhould periſh &amp; die.
This is greatly furthered by the croſſe, which God according to his diuine
will layeth vpon vs, which we ought not to caſt from vs, but beare it
willingly &amp; with a patient mind. But that this might be eaſier for vs to
doe, euen Chriſt hath taken it vpon him ſelfe, he ſuffered him ſelfe to
be baptized, and tooke his croſſe and caried it nothing reſiſting or
gayneſaying, and ſo was obedient to his father vnto the death, euen the
death of the croſſe, as Paule ſayth Philip. 2. that he might deliuer vs
from ſinnes, and might againe appeaſe his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, which ſurely
he did of his mere grace without any deſert of ours: whereof we haue
baptiſme a ſigne &amp; pledge, as Paule ſayth vnto Titus: <hi>But vvhen
that bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and that loue of God our Sauiour tovvard man appeared, not
by the vvorks of righteouſnes, vvhich vve had done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9413:23"/> to his mercy he ſaued vs, by the vvashing of the nevve
birth, and the renuing of the holy Ghoſt, vvhich he shed on vs aboundantly,
through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, that vve being iuſtified by his grace,
should be made heires according to the hope of eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the holy Ghoſt appeareth here in the likenes of a
doue, when Chriſt is baptized,<note place="margin">The ſecond thing to be
conſidered in the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Chriſt.</note> whereby is ſignified that
we alſo doe receiue the holy Ghoſt in our baptiſme, which ruleth and
gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs according to the will of God, which is preſent with vs, &amp;
helpeth vs in bearing the burden of the holy croſſe, which exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs,
is inſtant vpon vs, enforceth vs, and when we yeld to the burden of the
croſſe, is preſent and helpeth vs: if we fall, rayſeth vs vp againe,
and is with vs as a certeine faithfull companion in our iorney. He alſo
maketh the burden of the croſſe light, which we were very vnable to beare,
if he did not put to his helpe. If ſo be that thou fall into ſinne,
remember to goe backe vnto thy Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, for this is the onely ſhip,
wherein we paſſe ouer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heede of them which make two tables,
wherby we paſſe ouer the ſea of ſinnes, namely baptiſme and
repentance. Beleeue them not, whatſoeuer they handle, it is mere deluſion:
baptiſme is the beginning of repentance. As often therefore as thou falleſt
into ſinne, haue recourſe vnto thy baptiſme, there thou ſhalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
obtaine the holy Ghoſt, who may be preſent with thee. For repentance is
nothing elſe, but a diſpleaſing of him ſelfe, a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of his
wicked life, and a renuing of the man, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in baptiſme.
After ſuch a renuing of the life, followeth the prayſe of God, and
thankesgiuing vnto him for the grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, then ſuch a man burſteth
forth, &amp; behaueth him ſelf friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward his neighbour, &amp; doth
good to him in all thinges. This is ſignified by that, that the holy Ghoſt
appeared vpon Chriſt in the likenes of a doue: for a doue wanteth the gall.
Such they alſo become, which receiue the holy Ghoſt in baptiſme, to
witte, they are gentle and without all bitternes toward all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third thing to be conſidered in
the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Chriſt.</note> the voyce of the father is heard in the
baptiſme of Chriſt, which ſayth: <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in vvhom I
am well pleaſed.</hi> This is that Sauiour, which deliuereth vs from the
tyrannie of ſinne, death, Satan, and hell. And here we muſt learne, how we
muſt come vnto God. He that deſireth to be the grations &amp; deare childe
of God the father, muſt attaine vnto this <pb n="30" facs="tcp:9413:24"/> through
Chriſt, through him alone the beloued ſonne, who ſitteth in the boſom
of his father: vnto whom alone the father looketh, without whom he alloweth
nothing, and whatſoeuer pleaſeth the father, it pleaſeth him in reſpect
of this his ſonne. Wherefore he that deſireth to goe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, muſt
cleaue to this beloued ſonne, muſt lay him ſelfe vpon his backe. For by
this voice all titles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they ſeeme very goodly and holy, are taken
away, nothing is of value or eſtimation with the father but onely this his
beloued ſonne, he is in his eſpeciall fauour. Now he that deſireth to be
in fauour with the father, and to be beloued of him, let him flie into the
boſom of the ſonne, by whom afterward he findeth acceſſe to the father,
as Paule ſayth Ephe. 1. that through Chriſt we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, without this
Chriſt we are the enemies of God. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer therefore cleaueth to Chriſt
through faith, he abideth in the fauour of God, he alſo ſhall be made
beloued and acceptable, as Chriſt is, and ſhall haue felowſhip with the
father and the ſonne. But where this is not done, there is nothing but wrath,
there no honeſtie, no vertue, no free will, neither prayer, nor faſting,
nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes ſhall profit, thou ſhalt but trifle with all theſe. For
this is a moſt mighty, and moſt excellent voice: This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
ſonne, in whom all thinges conſiſt and are comprehended, which are extant
in the whole Scripture. Euen as all things are deliuered into the handes of
Chriſt, and gathered into one, that they may obey him, as S. Paule ſayth.
For when God ſayth: <hi>This is my beloued ſonne,</hi> by ſhewing
Chriſt only, and ſhewing and naming no other, he maketh it plaine enough,
that none is his beloued ſonne beſide him. If ſo be that other are not
beloued ſonnes, it is certaine that they are the children of wrath and
indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For if there were moe beloued ſonnes, he would not ſo ſet
forth &amp; ſhew this ſonne alone, ſaying: <hi>This is my beloued
ſonne,</hi> neither would turne his eyes vnto him onely, and glory of him
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as though he knew no other. For the words ſeeme to ſhew, that he
did diligently looke about, &amp; yet founde none, beſide him, of whome he
ſayth: this is he, as if he ſayde: Here at the laſt I haue founde ſuch
a one as pleaſeth me, and is my beloued ſonne, all other generally are not
ſuch.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, theſe wordes are not ſo onely to be vnderſtood,
that it is ſhewed by them that Chriſt is very God, as the Epiſtle to the
Hebrewes ſayth: <hi>Vnto which of the Angells ſayd he at any 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9413:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> time, Thou art my Sonne, this day begat I
thee?</hi> and againe, <hi>I will be his father, and he shall be my ſonne,
&amp;c.</hi> For it is moſt certaine that Chriſt in theſe wordes is
declared to be the true and naturall ſonne of God, ſeeing that this word
was neuer ſayd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature. Howbeit he had bene as well the ſonne of
God, and had ſo remayned for euer, as he hath bene from euerlaſting,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this had not bene ſpoken vnto vs from heauen, neither is any thinge
added or taken away from him by this name, but we muſt thus thinke &amp;
perſwade our ſelues, that ſo excellent a praiſe, and ſo noble honour
of Chriſt was ſpoken for our cauſe. For he him ſelfe witneſſeth in
Iohn,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.30.</note> that this came not
becauſe of him ſelfe, but for our ſakes. He hath no neede that it
ſhould be ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that he is the ſonne of God. He knew this
before, &amp; hath from euerlaſting &amp; by his nature, that which he
heareth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that is conceiued by voyce and word, it pertaineth to
vs, and not vnto Chriſt. Chriſt without the word, is ſuch as he is ſaid
to be. We haue the word without him, of whom it is ſpoken. Wherefore we
muſt lay faſt hold vppon the word without the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, euen as he hath
the eſſence without the word.</p>
               <p>But what doth this word? it teacheth vs to know Chriſt, in
which knowledge our ſaluation conſiſteth, as Eſay, Paule, and Peter doe
witnes. But how doth it teach vs to know him? ſo, that he is the ſonne of
God, and doth eſpecially pleaſe God his father, by which wordes God
cheereth the hartes of all the faithfull, and greatly delighteth them with mere
comfort, and heauenly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Howe is this done? When I knowe, and am
ſure, that this man Chriſt is the ſonne of God, and doth in all things
pleaſe the father, whereof I muſt be moſt fully perſwaded: foraſmuch
as the diuine maieſtie doth confirme this by his voyce from heauen, which can
not lye, whereby I am certaine, that whatſoeuer that man doth ſpeake and
worke, they are the mere wordes &amp; works of the beloued ſonne, which are
aboue meaſure approued of God. This therefore I doe ſingularly well marke,
and lay vppe in the bottom of my harte. When as therefore I doe hereafter heare
Chriſt ſpeake, or ſee him doe any thing, and that for my commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
which ſurely he euery where doth, (for he ſayth, that he doth and
ſuffereth all thinges for vs, that he came to ſerue and not that he
ſhould be ſerued,) then I remember theſe wordes of the father, that he is
the beloued ſonne, then I am enforced to <pb n="32" facs="tcp:9413:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> thinke,
that all that Chriſt ſpeaketh, doth, and ſuffereth, and that for my
ſake, doth ſingularly well pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>Nowe howe can God poure out him ſelfe more liberally, or
ſhew him ſelfe more louingly and ſweetely, then by ſaying, that it doth
pleaſe him from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, that Chriſt his ſonne doth ſpeake ſo gently
with me, doth with ſo great affection looke vnto my commoditie, and with
ſuch vnuſuall loue ſuffer, dye, and do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer for my ſake.
Doeſt thou dout, that if mans hart did with due ſenſe feele ſuch fauour
of God in Chriſt, to wit that he doth ſo much for our ſakes, it would not
for ioy burſt into moſt ſmall pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? for then it woulde looke into the
depth of the diuine breaſt, yea and into the exceeding and eternal goodnes
and loue of God, which he beareth toward vs, and hath borne toward vs from
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting. But we are too hard harted and cold, the fleſh doth lye more
heauy vppon vs, then that we are able to comprehend ſuch wordes, we doe not
wel conſider of them with our ſelues, neither doth our hart come neare to
feele how maruelous and vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loue and ioy they contayne in them,
otherwiſe without dout we ſhould perceiue, that heauen and earth are full
of the fire of the diuine loue, of life and righteouſnes, full of honour and
praiſe, whereunto the fire of hel, whereunto ſinne, &amp; death being
compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are nothing but as it were a thing painted or pictured. But we are
colde, ſluggiſh, &amp; vnthankfull wretches, for we paſſe ouer ſuch
precious words, as things of no importance, &amp; as vttered of man, as being
contayned in a booke, or writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in paper, as things vtterly decayed, and now
long ſince growne out of vſe by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, as though they pertayne
onely to Chriſt, and to vs nothing at all: And being dull and ſenſeles,
we doe not ſee that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long nothing to Chriſt, but were committed to
writing and are extant onely for our ſake.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that Chriſt the beloued ſonne, being in
ſo great fauour with God in all thinges that he doth, is thine, and doth in
the ſame, ſerue thee, as he him ſelfe witneſſeth, without dout thou
art in the ſame fauour and loue of God that Chriſt him ſelfe is in. And
againe, the fauour and loue of God are inſinuated to thee as deepely, as to
Chriſt, that now God together with his beloued ſonne, doth wholy
poſſeſſe thee, and thou haſt him againe wholy, that ſo God,
Chriſt, and thou doe become as one certaine thing. Hereunto make many
ſentences of the Goſpell, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <pb n="33" facs="tcp:9413:25"/> in Iohn,
as this: <hi>If any man loue me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi>

                  <hi>my father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and will
dwell with him.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: <hi>Where I am, there shall alſo my ſeruaunt
be.</hi> Againe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.26. <hi>Iohn</hi>
17.</note> I pray that they may be one in vs as thou and I are one, I in thee,
and thou in me, and they in me. But where is Chriſt? In the fauour of God, in
the depth of his hart, there alſo are we, if ſo be that we know and loue
Chriſt, there I thinke we are ſure enough, there our refuge is placed high
enough, whither no euill can come, as it is in the 91. Pſalme.</p>
               <p>But thou ſeeſt that faith is required hereunto, and that
vnto theſe thinges no law, no worke, no merit doth preuayle. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it
commeth to paſſe, that ſo precious wordes are ſo abſtruſe and
vnknowen to reaſon. For it hath bin gouerned of Satan from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creation of
the world, when as in Paradiſe it would be as God, &amp; preſumed after
honour, which God here attributeth to Chriſt alone, foraſmuch as he is his
ſonne, wherunto it is yet alſo prone and inclined, and ſetteth it ſelfe
againſt theſe words, &amp; the words againe are againſt it. For becauſe
Chriſt is here declared the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne of God, it is mightely ouerthrowne,
whatſoeuer maketh it ſelfe god. But who be they that make them ſelues
god? ſurely Satan and man, which pleaſe them ſelues, and loue them
ſelues, they ſeeke not after God, but ſtriue to attaine vnto this, that
they alſo may become gods. But what will God ſay vnto theſe: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a
certaine contrary thinge to that which he ſayde vnto Chriſt: Chriſt is my
beloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed, ſeeing that he glorifieth not
him ſelfe, and maketh not him ſelfe God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be God. But ye are
wretches, in whome I allowe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſeeing that ye glorifie your ſelues,
and make your ſelues gods, albeit ye be creatures and men, and not God. So
this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giuen of Chriſt doth humble the whole world, doth ſhew them
to be all voyd of diuinitie, and aſcribeth it to Chriſt, and that all for
our commoditie, if we will, and do admit this ſentence: or to our
condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we will not, and do contemne this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſo that I
may ſay at once: without Chriſt there is no fauour, nor any beloued
ſonne, but very wrath and ſore diſpleaſure of God.</p>

that both he and his poſteritie ſhould be deliuered, in thoſe wordes
which God ſpake to the Serpent:<note place="margin">

This comfort did vphold Adam with his poſteritie vntill Noe. For then the
promiſe was renued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God made a couenant with the ſonnes of Noe, and
ſet the raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe for a ſigne of the couenant, whereby men might conceiue
a truſt and confidence, that God is yet fauorable vnto them, and doth not
purpoſe their deſtruction: whereby mankinde was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpheld and
comforted euen vntill Abraham.</p>
               <p>In the time of Abraham God did ſomewhat ſhewe forth his
mercy, he declared that he would ſend a Sauiour, who ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs
againe from death both of body and ſoule: for albeit the body ſhould dye,
yet it ſhould not alwayes remayne in death, but riſe againe with the Lord
Chriſt: The wordes which God ſpake to Abraham Gen. 22. are thus: <hi>In thy
ſeede shall all the nations <pb n="38" facs="tcp:9413:28"/> of the earth be
bleſſed.</hi> Here miſerable men had a cauſe to hope and looke for a
Sauiour which ſhould deliuer them. From that time all the Prophets did
diuerſly foretell of this aboue meaſure flowing fountaine of all mercy,
that is, of this ſeede, of the Lord Chriſt, how that he at the laſt
ſhould come, that all which beleued in him, might obtaine ſaluation by that
promiſe which can not be reuoked. If ſo be that men would now open their
eyes, they muſt needes confeſſe and ſay, that a ſtraunge and
incredible thinge is done with vs, that man being in the ſtate of damnation,
curſed, &amp; deſperate, ſhould be reſtored by the natiuitie of one
man. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prophets cryed out with ardent prayers and vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
groning, that God would vouchſafe to ſende the Sauiour whom he had
promiſed. By faith in this Sauiour the Iſraelites afterward obtained the
lawe, and this honour before all people, that they were called the elect people

               <p>In the time of Dauid God made the comming of the Meſſias to

45.6.</note> as it is mentioned of him in an other Pſalme: <hi>Thy throne, O

                  <note place="margin">Who pertai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth to the kingdom of Chriſt,
and who to the kingdom of Satan.</note> Howebeit he is a ſpirituall king,
which ruleth the worlde by his worde: and whoſoeuer receiueth his word,
pertaineth to his kingdom. But he that is not vnder this ſcepter, neither
heareth his worde, is not of God, neither pertaineth to his kingdom, but is
ſubiect to the kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <pb n="39" facs="tcp:9413:28"/> vnder whoſe tyrannie
we all are, vntill the Lord doth deliuer vs from it, &amp; defend vs with his
ſcepter, which is then done when we beleeue in him. Foraſmuch therefore as
our ſaluation doth come meerly by the promiſe of God, let euery one
aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhal neuer obtaine ſaluation
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: although he ſhould do the workes of all Sainctes, yet
they ſhould profit him nothing hereunto. Contrariwiſe, if we lay hold on
the ſcepter of this king, that is, of the promiſe of God, we ſhal not
periſh, although the ſinnes of the whole world ſhould lye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, they
ſhal be all ſwallowed vp in him, albeit no good worke be done of vs. As we
ſee in the theefe, which hong by the Lord on the croſſe, who layd hold on
the word of God, &amp; beleued in Chriſt, and therefore he obtayned the
promiſed Paradiſe. Here is no dout left, let vs onely beleue that it is
ſo, and it is ſo in deede, all thinges which men teach, or which we haue
done or can doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet aſide. Here all thinges muſt giue place, at
the comming of this new king, that he alone may rule &amp; reigne in vs. Let a
man intermedle with thoſe thinges that are written of this king, as being his
owne matters, and as pertaining all vnto him.<note place="margin">Whatſoeuer is
written of Chriſt, it is written for our comfort.</note> For whatſoeuer is
written any where of Chriſt, it is written for our comfort, that we may
thereby feede and cheriſh our faith. To the eſtabliſhing of ſuch faith
God hath mercifully left vnto vs his promiſe written, and hath ſuffered to
be publiſhed, that he will performe that which he hath promiſed.
Whoſoeuer apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this in his hart, it muſt needes be that with
ſighing he thirſt for ſuch Scripture and promiſe of God, who of his
grace being not prouoked of vs, offereth vnto vs and beſtoweth vpon vs ſuch
goodnes and mercy.</p>
               <p>But let vs now come to our preſent text, which not with words
only, but alſo with a certeine force pearſeth the hart, and poureth into it
loue, pleaſure, ioy, gladnes, &amp;c. As if an Angell ſhould now come from
heauen, and ſay vnto vs miſerable and condemned wretches, after this
ſort: Behold O man, thou haſt ſinned, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt deſerued to
be condemned for euer. (This being heard the hart muſt needes tremble.) Now
although all this be true, yet neuertheles God of his grace hath mercy vppon
thee, &amp; ſendeth to thee a Sauiour, as he promiſed to Abraham and his
ſeede. Be of a good cheere, and giue thankes to God. Loe, here is the booke
of the generation of Ieſus Chriſt, who is the ſonne of 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9413:29"/> Dauid, the ſonne of Abraham, ſo that this is not onely
done, but alſo written, that thou mayſt be certaine thereof: Neither will
he, neither can he deceiue: beleue onely, and thou ſhalt haue all things. Now
it is to be noted that Matthew ſetteth Dauid before Abraham, although the
promiſe was firſt made to Abraham, and came afterward to Dauid, which
promiſe made to Dauid the Prophets did afterward publiſh more abroad, and
did by it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the people. As in the 11. chapter of Eſai, where the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth thus: <hi>There shall come a rod forth of the ſtocke of
Ieſſe, and a graffe shall growe out of his roote.</hi> Ieremie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſayth thus chap. 23. <hi>Behold the time commeth, ſayth the Lord, that I
wil raiſe vp the righteous braunch of Dauid, which king shall beare rule, and
he shall proſper with wiſedom, and shall ſet vp equitie &amp;
righteouſnes againe in the earth.</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch prophecies
there are to be found in the writings of the Prophetes, which they foretold of
Dauid, that his kingdom ſhould be rayſed vp, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Angell alſo declared
vnto Marie, when he ſayd:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32.</note>
                  <hi>The Lord God shall giue vnto him the throne of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew ſetteth Dauid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. <hi>Luke.</hi>
1.54.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; he shall reigne ouer the houſe of Iacob for euer, and
of his kingdome shall be none ende.</hi> Wherefore Matthew thought good here to
ſet Dauid firſt as the better knowne, &amp; next vnto him, Abraham, vnto
whom the promiſe was firſt made, as Marie in her ſong ſayth: <hi>He
remembring his mercy hath hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his ſeruaunt Iſraell, as he promiſed to
our fathers, Abraham &amp; his ſeede for euer.</hi> And that promiſe is now
performed, and in this our text deſcribed, as we ſhal ſee hereafter. S.
Matthew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a triple difference of fathers, of whom Chriſt came,
foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Patriarkes, foureteene Kings, &amp; foureteene Princes. For it
behoued that the ſcepter &amp; kingdom ſhould be taken from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10.</note> according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propheſie of Iacob,
which is thus: <hi>The ſcepter shall not depart from Iuda, and a lawegiuer
from betwene his feete, vntill Silo come: and vnto him shall the gathering of
the people be.</hi> Here all thinges muſt be fulfilled: and there are
thriſe foureteene generations, euen as Matthew rehearſeth them: from
Abraham to Dauid foureteene generations, from Dauid til they were caried away
into Babylon likewiſe foureteene generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Howbeit there is a perſon
omitted in Matthew, that is Iakim, &amp; it ought thus to be written:
<hi>Ioſias begat Iakim, &amp; Iakim begat Iechonias and his brethren,</hi>
this the Chronicles witnes. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="41" facs="tcp:9413:29"/> they were caried
away into Babylon vntill Chriſt, foureteene generations. Which triple
diſtinction hath a great myſterie as we ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p>The Iewes among other lawes were commaunded to obſerue theſe
three precepts, namely, to worſhip that God whom their fathers had
worſhipped. Secondly to chooſe no Prieſt of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtocke then of
their owne, that is, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tribe of Leui. Thirdly to chooſe no king but of
their owne people. Theſe three precepts did very wel agree in our Lord
Chriſt, to wit, that he is that one God, that he is an eternall Prieſt, of
our fleſh &amp; blood, &amp; a King, our brother, who hath taken our nature
vpon him: Who by his diuine power is able to help &amp; ſaue vs, &amp; being
an eternal Prieſt, continually maketh interceſſion for vs. He is a King
alſo, that he may defend &amp; preſerue vs, who is not to be feared of vs,
ſeing that he is a man as we are, yea &amp; was made a moſt contemptible
man, that our hart might be wholy quieted &amp; appeaſed in him our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
who can neuer forſake vs. Who were able to ſtand in the ſight of God,
&amp; not be terrified, if that Prieſt did not ſtand before God? Who
ſhould defend vs, if he were not a King? Who ſhould ſaue vs, if he were
not God? How ſhould he haue care of vs, if he were not a man, and our
brother? with whom we may ſpeake as wel as we may one with an other among our
ſelues. O moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sauiour, how wiſely haſt thou done all
thinges? I knowe that thou art my brother, as it is in the Pſalme:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi>
22.21.</note> 
                  <hi>I will declare thy name vnto my brethren,</hi> as it is
alleaged in the Epiſtle to the Hebr. Albeit thou art God, my Lord Chriſt,
and king of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, yet I can not be afraide of thee: for thou art
my friend and brother. This is no hinderance vnto me, that I am a ſinner, and
thou holy. For if I had not bene a ſinner, there had bene no neede that thou
ſhouldeſt ſuffer puniſhment for me.<note place="margin">Why both good and
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in the genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Chriſt.</note> I ſee alſo
in thy genealogie that both good and euill are rehearſed, of whoſe
poſteritie thou wouldeſt come, that thou mighteſt comfort timorous and
weake conſciences, that they ſhould confidently &amp; cheerefully put their
truſt in thee, which haſt taken away our ſinnes. And that we might be
certaine hereof, thou haſt left vnto vs thy word, which aſſuredly
declareth it vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings &amp; Princes which Matthew rehearſeth, ſome
were exceeding euil, as we may read in the bookes of the Kings. Yet God
ſuffereth them to be rehearſed in his genealogie, as if <pb n="42" facs="tcp:9413:30"/> they were worthy, that he ſhould come of them. But he ſuffered
not ſo much as one honeſt woman to be rehearſed therin. Fower women are
named, which all had an euill report, and were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lewd.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.</note> As Thamar, of whom Iudas the father of

2.1.</note> as in the firſt booke of Moſes it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Rahab is
called an harlot in the booke of Ioſua. Ruth was a heathen woman, of whom
although we read no euill writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet foraſmuch as ſhe was a heathen,
ſhe was deſpiſed of the Iewes as a dogge, and was deteſted of them.
Bethſabe the wife of Vrias was an adultereſſe before ſhe was maried to
Dauid, &amp; of her he begat Salomon. Which women are vndoutedly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearſed, that we may ſee how God hath ſet forth as it were a certaine
glaſſe vnto all ſinners, wherein they may ſee that he would be borne of
the poſteritie of ſinners, that the greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners we be, ſo much
more certaine and greater refuge we might haue to ſo gracious a God,
Prieſt, &amp; King, who is our brother, in whom onely and in none other we
are able to fulfill the law, &amp; obtaine the grace of God: he came downe from
heauen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither doth he require any thing of vs, but that we
aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleue that he is our God,<note place="margin">By faith in

ſinners may leape for ioy, that they are counted worthy of ſuch a Sauiour.
Muſt not he needes be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, whoſe hart vnderſtandeth and feeleth
this? yea he is cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a moſt ardent loue to leade a newe life, for he
is inſpired with the grace of God, inaſmuch as he layeth hold of the
promiſe of remiſſion of all his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>If we will count vppon our fingers the perſons rehearſed in
this text, we ſhall finde them to be forty and two, which were in time paſt
figured by the two and forty manſion places, which the children of Iſraell
had, before they came into the promiſed land, as it is written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth
booke of Moſes. If we alſo will come into the promiſed land, which our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs by his natiuitie, we muſt alſo
occupie two and forty manſion places, that is, we muſt ceaſſe from our
owne purpoſe, &amp; be regenerate man by man, vntill we come to Marie and
Ieſus, there at the laſt we ſhall finde reſt vnto our ſoules. But
this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie <pb n="43" facs="tcp:9413:30"/> is hard: for our euill &amp; corrupt
nature is very loth to leaue her owne wil and purpoſe. And againe the caſe
of nature is ſuch, that no natiuitie can be without griefe, yet one hath more
griefe, tentation and affliction then an other. The theefe on the croſſe
leapt at one leap two and forty degrees, and came ſodainely to Chriſt. So
did many Martyrs alſo, and other holy men. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding none can goe
ſo great a iorney with ſmall griefe, vnleſſe he be caried with a great
winde, that is by the holy Ghoſt. We muſt goe fayre and ſoftly from
Abraham to Iſaac, from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac to Iacob, and ſo forth. But we muſt begin
at Abraham, that we may be found endued with like faith as he was, and obtaine
the bleſſing promiſed vnto him, then we ſhall more eaſily and
cheerefully goe from one Patriarch to an other. That is, we ſhal paſſe
ouer one affliction after an other, vntill we be called out of this trauell and
iorney vnto our reſt.<note place="margin">Why the godly muſt ſuffer
affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in this world.</note> For a man muſt be ſo long exerciſed

be brought vnder, and his fleſh by this meanes be ſubdued, that it may obey
the ſpirit, and walke ioyfully in the will and obedience of God. Wherefore

And he afterward interpreting him ſelf, expoundeth them for kingdoms and
Kinges: and this is a phraſe and maner of ſpeaking peculiar to this
language. Nowe Zacharias ſignifieth that Chriſt is our head, yea our God,
whoſe kingdom is his horne.</p>
               <p>He addeth: <hi>the horne of ſaluation,</hi> or
bleſſednes.<note place="margin">What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwene other
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms &amp; the kingdom of ſaluation which God hath rayſed vp.</note>
Some king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are famous in name and power, other are large, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with
plentie of greate treaſures, much people, honours, and all temporall thinges:
But this is called a kingdome of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, grace, life, righteouſnes,
truth, and of euery thinge that pertayneth to ſaluation, whereby it differeth
from all other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. For albeit they be large, riche or mightie, yet are
they counted the kingdoms of death, for they that gouerne them muſt at the
laſt fall, dye, periſh, and leaue their power and riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.
Neyther was there euer any worldely kingdome which might be called a kingdom of
life, wherein is life, peace, and ſaluation, for onely the kingdome of
Chriſt doth glory and triumph in this title, inaſmuch as God hath rayſed
it vppe, that there may be nothing in it but ſaluation and felicitie.
Moreouer I finde nothing here ſpoken of maners and trades of life, or of
workes: For this kingdome conſiſteth neyther in outward life nor workes,
but in the horne, in Chriſt, and his Goſpell. This kingdom is ours, whereof
ye haue heard, that it is a kingdom of grace, life, righteouſnes, ſaluation
and mercy, ſo that whoſoeuer is in it, although he be inferior to Iohn in
holines, and farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Chriſt in perfection, yet he liueth in a kingdom
wherein is nothing but ſaluation and bleſſednes, whereof alſo it hath
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth the name.</p>
               <p>It is ſayd moreouer that this kingdom is rayſed vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
houſe of Dauid: but by what meanes was it rayſed vp? euen by the holy
Ghoſt, and by his worde. He ſayth, <hi>in the houſe of Dauid.</hi> 
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:9413:33"/> for it muſt be a kingdome in the earth, and yet a
kingdome of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Nowe conferre theſe two one with an other. The
houſe of Dauid is the tribe and ſtocke of Dauid, who was a man, as the
ſubiects of his kingdom. So that thou canſt not ſay, that he doth here
make mention of an heauenly kingdome amonge the Angells, when as he doth
nothing leſſe, but he ſpeaketh of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kingdome which is amonge
men, which liue clothed with fleſh. Dauid was a man, the ſubiects of his
kingdome alſo were men, ſubiect to death. For as the Scripture
witneſſeth, man that is borne of a woman liueth but a ſmall time, he can
not paſſe the boundes appoynted him. Howe is it then that honour and
diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour come together in this kingdom? What agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
appeareth here, where mortall men are deliuered from the power of death, where
they that are worthy of death, enioy life, the vnhappy are happy, and they that
are ſubiect to Satan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſonnes of God? In the reaſon hereof I
hope that ye are ſufficiently inſtructed, yea I thinke that ye vnderſtand
it as well as I my ſelfe. But becauſe the text ſo requireth, it muſt be
eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones repeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Chriſtian is deliuered from death,
ſinne, &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note>We haue affirmed therefore, that a Chriſtian
which liueth in this kingdom, ſhall neuer dye, foraſmuch as he can not dye.
For Chriſt hath therefore ſuffered deathe, that he might ouercome death,
and deliuer vs from it. He tooke our ſinnes alſo vpon him ſelfe, that we
might not neede to beare them. Moreouer he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ouerthrew Satan, that
we might not be ſubiect vnto him. Wherefore it is giuen to a Chriſtian that
he can neuer dye, he can neuer be ſubiect to ſinne and the deuill. For that
muſt needes be true which he ſayth, that he hath rayſed vp an horne of
bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or ſaluation. And in whatſoeuer place that horne ſhall
be, there is no acceſſe neither for death, neither for ſinne, nor the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. And that in the houſe of Dauid. Wherefore a Chriſtian is both
defiled and yet without ſinne,<note place="margin">A Chriſtian after a ſort
ſubiect to death, ſinne, and Satan, &amp; why.</note> and free from Satan.
Howe commeth this to paſſe? After this ſorte. Your brotherly charitie
hath oftentimes heard heretofore, that God leaueth in vs an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and
feeling of death and the deuill, ſo that my ſinne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieteth me and
troubleth my conſcience, and would driue me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſperation. Moreouer the
iudgement of God terrifieth me, death aſſaileth me, as if it would deuoure
me. Satan is at hande and ſeeketh to ſuppreſſe me. God ſuffereth
theſe to remaine &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <pb n="49" facs="tcp:9413:33"/> them not quite away. For
this appearance muſt continue, that we may perceiue and feele that we are
nothing elſe of our ſelues but ſinners, ſubiect to ſinne and Satan.
And yet vnder this appearance lieth hid, life, innocencie, and dominion and
victorie ouer ſinne, Satan, hell, &amp;c, as Chriſt him ſelfe ſayth
Matth. 16. <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will I build my Church,
&amp; the gates of hell shall not preuaile againſt it,</hi> he ſayth not,
they ſhall not aſſaile it, nor fight againſt it: for theſe two
remayne to ſinne and death.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is alſo expedient that I feele the biting of ſinne,
the terrour of the wrath of God, the horrour of death, yea and death it
ſelfe. But all this is a certaine outward appearance before my ſight and
the ſight of the world,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of Chriſtians
againſt ſinne death, and Satan.</note> which knowe and iudge none
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that ſinne, death, and Satan are preſent.
Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the meane ſeaſon vnder that aſſault and terrour
the word and ſpirit are, encouraging me, preſeruing me, &amp; aſſuring
me, that God is not angry with me, that my ſinne is forgiuen me, that I
ſhall neither dye, nor be forſaken: Vpon this foundation &amp; hope my hart
doth wholy reſt. And no man hauing ſuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in God, remaineth
vnder ſinne, neither is drowned in death, but is made a conquerour of ſinne
and death. This is, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile or ouercome, for that albeit Satan
attempteth, yet he doth not get the victorie. We call the houſe of Dauid, a
mortal houſe, ſinnefull, and ſubiect to the deuill, according to the
maner of all fleſh and blood, and yet notwithſtanding the horne of
ſaluation is rayſed vp in the ſame,<note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
faith</note> that men of that kingdom may enioy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and felicitie.
Hereby ye ſee that this kingdom is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of faith, which can not be
touched nor outwardly perceiued of any, which one can not ſhewe to an other,
but euery one muſt haue it in him ſelf, that when he ſhall draw neare
vnto death, ſhal feele ſinne, or euen ſee death before him, he may then
in faith lay hold on this kingdom, &amp; beleue that his ſinnes are forgiuen
him. For Chriſt therefore died, that thou mighteſt be in this kingdom of
faith. Wherefore ſinne ſhal encounter with thee in vaine, death is taken
away, Chriſt is with thee, who can hurt thee, who can do any euill vnto thee?
Here life and death, ſinne and innocencie, Chriſt and Satan doe fight one
with an other, but Chriſt, life, &amp; innocencie doe ouercome and conquer.
This is ſoone ſpoken, but not ſo eaſily felt, yea the contrary ſurely
is rather felt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="50" facs="tcp:9413:34"/> if thou wilt eſteeme and
conſider this kingdom according to the iudgement of the world, thou ſhalt
vtterly erre and be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The world calleth that a good &amp; peaceable
kingdom, where all thinges are quiet, proſperous and goe well forward, where
is ſafetie, peace, and innocencie outwardly. But here is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
ſaluation and grace, although it alwayes appeare other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Wherefore all
theſe thinges are to be vnderſtood in ſpirit and faith, &amp; not to be
iudged according to the perſon or outward appearance.</p>
               <p>Neither ought it to ſeeme ſtraunge that this kingdom doth
flouriſh in the middes of ſinnes, the force of Satan &amp; death, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Zacharias here ſingeth euen from the bottom of his hart, and knoweth well how
it commeth to paſſe, faith and the ſpirit reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it. Concerning
ſinne I haue ſeene or knowen none in whom it is not.<note place="margin">Euen
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt holy are not free from ſinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.</note>
Whomſoeuer thou ſetteſt before thee, ſinne will by and by appeare.
Paule a moſt holy Apoſtle affirmeth of him ſelfe, that he feeleth ſinne
in his members. <hi>VVill,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>is preſent with me, but I
find no meanes to performe that which is good. For I doe not the good thing
which I would, but the euil which I would not, that do I.</hi> He wiſhed in
deede to be free from ſinnes, but yet he could not but liue in them. And I
and ſuch like are alſo deſirous to be exempted from ſinnes: but that
can by no meanes be brought to paſſe, we doe onely repreſſe and keepe
them vnder: when we haue fallen into ſinne, we riſe againe. But as long as
we are clothed with this fleſh, and beare the burden thereof about with vs,
ſo long ſinne is not extinguiſhed nor can be wholy ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We may
well goe about and endeuour to ſubdue it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding old Adam will
leade his life alſo, vntill he ſhall dye and come vnto the graue. What
ſhall I neede to ſay any more? The kingdom of Chriſt is a certaine
ſpeciall kingdom, wherein euery one of the Sainctes is compelled to make this
confeſſion: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, vnto whoſe power all thinges acknowledge them
ſelues ſubiect, I confeſſe my ſelf to be a miſerable ſinner,
reuenge not, I beſeech thee my old iniquities. Al alſo muſt ſing this
ſong: Our father, &amp;c. forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them
that treſpaſſe againſt vs. Other righteous &amp; holy ones, which knowe
no meaſure or ende of their righteouſnes and holines, doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
nothing hereof, and therefore this Goſpell is not preached vnto them,
ſeeing that they thinke the kingdom of Chriſt to be <pb n="51" facs="tcp:9413:34"/>
ſuch, that there is no ſinne at all in it, but that all thinges in it are
cleane &amp; pure: they require ſuch a Chriſtian as is wholy cleane from
all filth of ſinne, and without ſinne as Chriſt him ſelfe, ſuch a one
they ſhall neuer be able to finde.</p>
               <p>Now he is a Chriſtian, who being a ſinner, confeſſeth
him ſelf a ſinner, who hateth the feeling of ſinne, ſtriuing againſt
it from his hart. He is not a Chriſtian which thinketh that he hath no
ſinne, neither feeleth any. But if thou knoweſt any ſuch, he is an
Antichriſtian, and not a true Chriſtian. The kingdom of Chriſt therefore
conſiſteth among ſinnes, it is eſtabliſhed there where he hath ſet
it, that is, in the houſe of Dauid. Yea ſet Dauid him ſelfe before your
eyes, and ye ſhal finde him to haue bene a ſinner: who notwithſtanding is
bold to glory, that he is a ſeruant acceptable to his Lord. There is none of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull which ought to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this maner of praying vnto God,
or of any other not much vnlike vnto it: Lorde forgiue vs our ſinne: is it
therefore true that they haue ſinne, becauſe they ſay ſo? yea truely,
for if they ſhould lye, they ſhould be the children of Satan. But godly
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are weary of this life, greatly deſiring the life to come. Now
it is not giuen vnto them in this earth to goe ſo farre, that they may ſay:
We are ſubiect to no vices, we are cleane from all ſinne: if they ſhall
goe ſo farre, it is Satan that deceiueth them. Notwithſtanding they are
ſorie for their ſinnes, and doe lament them, yea it grieueth them to the
hart, that they muſt beare the miſerable burden of this fleſh, and they
crie out together with S. Paule Rom. 7. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall
deliuer me from the body of this death?</hi> This ſhrite &amp; crie all the
faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doe giue, for that feeling ſinne, they doe moſt earneſtly
deſire to be deliuered from it. And in this feeling &amp; knowledge of
ſinne, the kingdom of Chriſt conſiſteth, ſo, that euen in ſinne
there is no ſinne. That is, albeit I doe both acknowledge and feele
ſinne,<note place="margin">Though the godly haue ſinne in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and feele the
grieuouſnes thereof, yet it doth not hurt them.</note> yet ſaluation and
the kingdom doe ſo firmely abide in my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that God ſayth vnto
me: I will forgiue thee thy ſinne, for that thou haſt faith, and
beleeueſt in Chriſt my eſpecially belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſonne, who was deliuered to
death for thee, neither ſhall thy ſinnes hurt thee. Others, which feele not
their ſinnes, but truſt in their workes, and complaine nothing of their
faultes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thinking them ſelues cleane: ſuch are giuen to
Satan, &amp; not receiued or admitted into the kingdom of Chriſt: for they
which <pb n="52" facs="tcp:9413:35"/> are partakers of this kingdom can not be without
conflicts and tribulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Death, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and the world doe ſomewhat
trouble the godly, but the godly at the laſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
118.18.</note>And that I may ſpeake more plainly, recken I pray thee, any of
the Sainctes, whom death doth not trouble: yea I know thou ſhalt not finde
one, which is not afraid, and trembleth not at the horrible ſight of death.
But the conſcience taketh comfort here by the Prophet Dauid, who ſayth:
<hi>The Lorde hath chaſtened and corrected me, but he hath not giuen me ouer
vnto death:</hi> it fighteth againſt vs in deede, but it preuaileth not. Thus
a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wrapped in ſinnes, is both vnder ſinnes and aboue ſinnes,
&amp; at the laſt notwithſtanding obtaineth the victorie. After the ſame
ſort alſo muſt he haue to doe with Satan, with whom he muſt wraſtle
all his life, and at the laſt ouercome him. So in the world alſo he muſt
ſuffer many conflicts and troubles, and yet at length become victor. For
although it be a kingdom of ſaluation, which hath neither reſt nor
quietnes, but ſuffreth the force of hel, death, the deuill, ſinne, and all
maner of aduerſitie and tribulation, yet they which be in it, doe with an
inuincible courage endure, and at length ouercome all euills. But God therefore
permitteth theſe thinges, that our faith may be exerciſed, and ſhew forth
it ſelfe. Moreouer that is a pleaſure to the conſcience, and bringeth
vnto it comfort and ioye, that it hath ſuch a kingdom, that it may ſay:
Bleſſed be the Lord God, who hath viſited and redeemed vs, and hath
raiſed vp a kingdom in the houſe of Dauid. That is, for that he viſiteth
vs by his word, deliuereth vs from ſinnes, and maketh vs conquerours ouer
death and Satan.</p>
               <p>Thus he haue heard both that a kingdom is rayſed vp in the
houſe of Dauid, and alſo that a Chriſtian is both dead and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, is
innocent in the middes of ſinnes, and although he be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Satan, yet
notwithſtanding hath dominion ouer Satan. For both are true, for that
ſinne, death, hell doe aſſaile the fleſh, but doe not ouercome,
foraſmuch as this kingdom of ſaluation triumpheth ouer them all. Wherefore
as it were with a certaine great boldnes or confidence he calleth it a horne,
that is a ſtronge and puiſſant kingdom: Which hath no reſt or truce,
but being aſſailed of many and ſtronge enemies, is alwayes diligently
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in defence of it ſelfe, and doth notably repell the force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
enemie. So a Chriſtian laying hold on this horne, ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſinne,
death, and Satan. Neither conſiſteth this horne in our <pb n="53" facs="tcp:9413:35"/>
ſtrength, neither are we makers thereof: for God hath made and rayſed it vp
by the miniſterie of his word, whereby we are ſaued. Wherefore Zacharias
ſo ſingeth, that his ſonge hath reſpect not to his own ſonne, but to
Chriſt. Yea he celebrateth this kingdom as pertaining to the Iewes onely, and
declareth that it ſhall be glorious, and maketh no mention of the Gentiles,
how they alſo ſhould come vnto it, as beſide others, Simeon in his
ſong, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning whereof is, <hi>Lorde nowe letteſt thou, &amp;c.</hi>
did prophecie, that we Gentiles alſo are choſen into that kingdom. But here
he foretelleth of a kingdom rayſed vp of God to the Iewes, euen a kingdom of
ſaluation and bleſſednes, and that in the houſe of his ſeruaunt
Dauid. Wherefore he ſayth moreouer:</p>

neither that we ſerue the world, and labour to haue no enemies therein. For
the words of Zacharias declare that it is the quality of this kingdom to
deliuer from enemies. Now if it deliuereth vs from enemies, and as it were
draweth vs out of the hands of them that hate vs, ſurely it can not be a
kingdom of peace, but ſuch a kingdom as is ſubiect to the hatred and malice
of the world. As ye ſee at this daye, that our enemies beare a deadly hatred

men. And this is the ſtate, theſe are the badges, and cogniſances of
Chriſtians: that when Satan by his miniſters perſecuteth vs, he thinketh
quite to roote vs out. This verſe alſo giueth vs to vnderſtand, that
Chriſt is our King, that he may ſaue and deliuer vs out of the handes of
our enemies: which he notably performeth, and ſheweth his power in the middes
of the worlde, in the middes of the force of fleſh and Satan, when as peace
and quietnes is no where left to a Chriſtian, but in his Chriſt alone. This
alſo we muſt marke, that there is not one but many, which aſſayle &amp;
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Chriſtians: but yet that we ſhall not therefore be
deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:9413:36"/> foraſmuch as we haue one, which is
ſtronger both then the world and the Prince thereof as Iohn ſayth. Nowe
whereas he promiſeth vs, we know certainly, that he both will and is able to
performe: we ſhall in deede feele the aſſault, but he will not ſuffer
vs to be deſtroyed or ouercome, ſo that we hope and truſt in him. It

a Chriſtian muſt be as it were ouerwhelmed with all euills together, ſo
alſo he ſhal be againe wholy deliuered from all euils. And he ſheweth
that this grace and bleſſing was promiſed to their fathers. Such is the
maner of the Apoſtles alſo, that they often times haue recourſe to the
old Teſtament, as I haue ſayd before, that God ſpake and promiſed by
the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. euen as Zacharias doth in this place.<note place="margin">An obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Some man may now ſay: They are dead, how
therefore will he ſhew mercy vnto them? Againe, what neede is there to
rehearſe, that he woulde ſhew mercy to the fathers, when as it is declared
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets? But this is therefore done,<note place="margin">The
au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer.</note> that the truth of God may be ſhewed forth, and may be
alſo approued vnto vs, that we ſhoulde not be ignorant, that thoſe
thinges are not due to our merits. In the firſt booke of Moſes is
mentioned, how God promiſed to Abraham,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi>
22.18.</note> that in his ſeede all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nations of the earth ſhould be
bleſſed. That is, that by Chriſt ſhould come peace, grace, and
bleſſing to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which promiſe was differred ſo long a time,
that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that it was in vaine and aboliſhed. So vnwiſe, as it
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the worlde, doth God ſhewe him ſelfe in his matters, as
though all thinges went backward. Notwithſtanding howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it was delayed
and ſeemed, yet it is fulfilled and performed whatſoeuer was promiſed to
Abraham, and God hath not onely deliuered him from his enemies, but hath
beſtowed vpon him all good thinges, yea hath giuen him ſelfe vnto him, and
all that he hath. And all this is therefore done, for that (as Zacharias here 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9413:37"/> ſayth) this mercy and goodnes was before promiſed and
confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an oth vnto them, which are long ſince dead, when as we yet
were not. He is mercifull therefore and fauourable, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our
merits, as though he did owe it vnto our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but of his onely
grace, fauour, and mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">God both promiſed, &amp; fulfilled his
promiſe, not moued through any workes or merits of men, but of his meere
grace and mercy.</note>Theſe are horrible thundrings againſt our merits
&amp; workes, that we can not glory, that we haue deliuered our ſelues from
ſinnes, or that we haue deſerued his goodnes, and the preaching of the
Goſpell. No, it is not ſo. Here is no place for boaſting: but this text
ſayth, that thou, O Lorde, didſt promiſe certaine thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of yeares
before I was borne, that thou wouldeſt doe it. Who did then deſire him,
that he would giue vs thoſe thinges, when he had determined with him ſelfe
to giue them? And vpon this promiſe the Prophets are bold and doe ſtay them
ſelues, for by it we attaine vnto true goodnes, that the mouth of euery one
may be ſtopped, that he that wil glory, may glory in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. For thus the
Lord may ſay: that thou liueſt in my kingdom, that thou enioyeſt my
goodnes &amp; grace, it is not to be imputed to thee, but vnto me: I
promiſed, and determined with my ſelfe to fulfill my promiſes, thou being
ignorant thereof. And here the mouth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is ſtopped. So at this day
alſo none of vs, vnto whom, thankes be to God, the Goſpel hath ſhined,
can glory that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it by our owne meanes, labour, endeuour, or good
conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. For thoſe which were counted the beſt workes, and the
moſt excellent ſtudies are diſallowed and ouerthrowne, as to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
Maſſe, to ioyne him ſelfe to this or that hypocriticall ſect, which
they call an order, &amp;c. Theſe the Goſpell condemneth and reiecteth, and
how can I attaine to the Goſpell by that which it reiecteth? Wherefore this
ſtandeth ſure and certaine, that all that we haue, is of the meere grace
and goodnes of God, ſo that with his honour and praiſe we may confeſſe,
that we haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued farre otherwiſe, namely hell fire, if beſides this
he beſtoweth any thing vpon vs, it is the gift of his grace and goodnes. And
this is that which Zacharias ſayth, that is was foretold by the Prophets, and
both promiſed and confirmed by an oth to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16.</note> that he would performe vnto vs the
couenant made to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham. Thus he ſayth to Abraham: <hi>By my ſelfe haue I
ſworne, ſayth the Lorde, that in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee. And
in thy ſeede, &amp;c.</hi> Which words the Prophets diligently held, marked, 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9413:37"/> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, &amp; alwaies truſted vnto them, for that he
doth here ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweare, that he might wholy aſſure vs, that he
would poure forth his bleſſing vpon vs. And now the time is preſent, the
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is come, wherein, he hath ſworne, that ſaluation ſhould come vnto
vs, as it is declared Mar. 16. <hi>Goe ye into all the world &amp; preach the
Goſpell to euery creature: he that shall beleue &amp; be baptiſed, shall be
ſaued: but he that will not beleeue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abraham merited
not the promiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>shall be damned.</hi> Men ſurely haue not
merited it, no not Abraham him ſelfe, who was not made partaker of the
promiſe, ſeeing that he died long before the fulfilling thereof. In
ſpirit in deede and faith he was partaker of it, but he liued not ſo long,
til the Goſpel was reuealed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world The promiſe therfore was
made vnto him, although, as I haue ſayd, he looked not for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulfilling
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in this life. That is, his life was not prolonged vntill the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Goſpell in the whole world, although in faith he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the
Goſpell for him ſelfe. Wherefore it can not be ſayd, that that promiſe
was due to his merits, otherwiſe he muſt haue liued in the earth vntill the
fulfilling thereof, and a due price or reward muſt haue bene payd vnto him.
But now the performing of the promiſe was after his death, ſo that euery
one muſt needes confeſſe, that that promiſe was not made to Abraham
becauſe of his merits.</p>
               <p>Againe, it can not be ſayd,<note place="margin">The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
merited not the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of the promiſe.</note> that the Gentiles which
enioy this promiſe, haue obtained it by their merits, which then were not.
God promiſeth to the fathers and performeth not, he performeth to the
Gentiles, to whom notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding no promiſe was made, who all at that time
were not. God will alwayes retayne to him ſelf his honour, and be the ſame
God, although the wicked world can not be ſo perſwaded. He chaſteneth,
reproueth, rebuketh, prouoketh, ſtirreth, allureth, doth whatſoeuer is to
be done, but the worldlings rob him of his honour, and attribute it to them
ſelues, that is, they will not acknowledge, that whatſoeuer they
poſſeſſe or haue, it commeth vnto them by the only grace of God. When
therefore we glory of ſuch good thinges, &amp; acknowledge not God to be the
author and giuer of them, we make our ſelues as God, and him as our
ſeruaunt. So he is diſhonoured, and the honour attributed vnto vs. But
albeit we make marchandize of his honour, yet he hath affirmed in the
Scriptures, that he will keepe his honour and glorye onely to him ſelfe, that
ſo <pb n="58" facs="tcp:9413:38"/> he may be acknowledged to giue all things of his
meere and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace. Theſe thinges he that beleueth, doth alſo receiue
them: he that doth not beleue, ſhall at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth receiue his due reward.

                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>He hath defined the nature and propertie of this kingdom: that
is, the couenant made with Abraham, that in his ſeede all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the
earth ſhould be bleſſed, &amp;c. Which words of bleſſing, thus
ſayth he, I will interpret vnto you, that being deliuered out of the handes
of our enemies, we may ſerue him without feare all our life long in holines
and righteouſnes before him. Which to the world and our fleſh ſauoureth
not well. For the world thus murmureth here: I had thought that he woulde haue
giuen vs ſome pretious thing, as a purſe well ſtuffed with money, a rich
wife, fayre and bewtifull children, goodly houſes, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the
world is delighted in. But now I perceiue it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I heare that
we muſt without feare ſerue him in holines &amp; righteouſnes, and ſo
pleaſe him. Wherefore it ſhall be meete that we apply hereunto ſpirituall
eyes and eares, that we may more rightly conſider and vnderſtand the
wordes. Whereas he ſayth, that he will deliuer vs from all our enemies, it is
againe thus to be vnderſtood, that this kingdom is placed in the middes of
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and notwithſtanding that it is not therefore deſtroyed, but that
alwayes all the enemies and aduerſaries thereof are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. We muſt
vnderſtand alſo that the deliuerance from our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies tendeth hereunto,
that we ſhould alwayes obey him that deliuereth vs, without any feare. And
this is a Chriſtian thing, &amp; an amiable kingdom, that a Chriſtian
ſhall leade his life without feare. Howbeit God hath beſtowed this vpon vs,
that we ſhould hereafter ſerue him alone.</p>
               <p>The words <hi>without feare,</hi> include in them, that we
ſhall qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly enioy the good thinges of this preſent world,<note place="margin">A Chriſtian how he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth without feare.</note> &amp; of the
world to come. For a Chriſtian is ſure and certaine of the forgiuenes of
his ſinnes, although he as yet feeleth them, as we haue ſayd a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9413:38"/> before. He is certaine that death hath no power in him:
that Satan doth not ouercome him: that the worlde can not preuaile againſt
him. Such a hart is without all perill and feare, &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from
them. Which doe not thou ſo vnderſtand, as though we do not feele ſinne
at all, but that we are greatly grieued when ſinnes trouble vs, when the
image or ſight of death terrifieth vs, when as being reproched and
ſclaundered of the world, we ſtand as deſtitute, and haue none in this
earth, to whom we may turne vs or reſort for ſuccour, but God alone.
Theſe thinges in deede are felt, but they doe not preuaile nor ouercome vs:
for the hart notwithſtanding remaineth ſafe and quiet in God. So pouertie
alſo is felt, when thou art pinched with hunger, &amp; haſt not
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to fill thy belly, to maintaine thy wife and bringe vp thy
children, nor any certaine place where to dwell and abide, but all theſe
thinges ſhall not hurt thee: thou muſt aske of God whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou
needeſt, &amp; ſerue him without feare, as our preſent text declareth.
But herein we doe for the moſt part behaue our ſelues not as Chriſtians,
we iudge after our owne affection and ſenſe, according as the world doth
blame vs, or report euill of vs. Alſo when our fieldes haue no corne, no
money is in our purſe, we thinke our ſelues vtterly deſtitute and
forſaken. But a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with ſhut eyes and eares ſayth with
Paule ſpeaking to the Galathians: O fleſh, ſinne, death, ye are dead vnto
me:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</note> and I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
am dead vnto you, that Chriſt may liue in me. The world is crucified vnto me,
and I vnto the worlde. That is, the worlde hath no care or regard of me, and my
preaching and life is moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſcorned of it. But with the ſame
meaſure that thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureſt vnto me, I will meaſure to thee againe: if
thou deſpiſeſt me, I alſo will deſpiſe thee: if thou makeſt no
account of me, I againe will make ſmall account of thee.</p>
               <p>What care I, if the world hate me, when as I diſpleaſe not
him that dwelleth in heauen? if this hatred continue euen dayly, if ſinne
rage, and the worlde talke and prate many thinges, what then? let it do ſo
vntill it be weary, I wil paſſe ouer theſe things as if I heard them not.
This is in deede to forſake the world, and to die vnto it, to liue without
feare, to be occupied about no other thing, but that which is according to Gods
will, to ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all but that which ſhall pleaſe him, and
which I ſhall know to be agreeable to his worde: that I may liue ſo, and
doe <pb n="60" facs="tcp:9413:39"/> thoſe workes, which I knowe certainly are acceptable
before him, that in my whole life whatſoeuer I doe either outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or
inwardely, I may be certaine that I ſeeke his glorye, and endeuour to fulfill
his will. So I am ſeparated from the world, and notwithſtanding doe ſtill
liue in the worlde. No man is leſſe in the world then a ſincere
Chriſtian: and againe, no man is more occupied and hath to doe with the world
then an entire Chriſtian. That is, the worlde doth more intentiuely looke
vnto him, and Satan more often and vehemently aſſaileth him, then him that
is ignorant of Chriſt, of grace, and of faith. Chriſt and Paule had
experience hereof: they had combats &amp; conflicts with the world: they were
troubled and moleſted, yea the whole world was againſt them. Againe, a true
Chriſtian is not in the worlde, albeit the world rage &amp; fret cruelly
againſt him: for he alwayes truſteth in God, and ſayth: Lord, I am thine,
thou ſhalt deale wel with me, graunt thou that my matters may goe forward
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy will, onely be thou on my ſide, and I ſhall be in
ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the dayes of our life.</hi> All our life long, that is
continually, without ceaſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In holines and righteouſnes before him.</hi> Here S. Luke
diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth righteouſnes and holines into two ſortes: of which one is
acceptable before God: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other before him is of no value: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we haue to
vnderſtand, that both the righteouſnes &amp; holines of God are in no
eſtimation before the world, euen as the worlde is wont nothing to eſteeme
God, and againe God litle to eſteeme the world. For that which God calleth
iuſt, the world calleth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt: and that which it calleth right, God
calleth crooked: and ſo theſe two Champions are continually at variance
betwene them ſelues. That which God calleth holy, ſeemeth to the world
deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and vnrighteous. Wherefore he comforteth vs here, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that
there be two ſortes of righteouſnes and holines: One, which we ought to
obſerue diligently: An other which we ought to auoide.<note place="margin">Hypocritical holines and righteouſnes</note> Hitherto it hath
bene the chiefe holines and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of all, which could be inuented, to
runne into Monaſteries, to put on monkiſh apparel, to be ſhauen, to weare
a hempten girdle, to giue him ſelfe to faſting and prayer, to be clothed
with heare cloth, to lye in wollen garments, to obſerue an auſtere maner of
liuing: and in a ſumme, to take vpon him monkiſh holines and religion. And
thus ſticking in a colourable ſhew of good works, <pb n="61" facs="tcp:9413:39"/> we
knewe none other but that we were holy from top to toe: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regarde onely
to workes and the body, and not to the hart, where we were full of hatred,
feare, &amp; incredulitie, troubled with an euil conſcience, knowing almoſt
nothing rightly of God. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world cried openly: O that holy man: O holy
and chaſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which haue included them ſelues within the walls of
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, which day &amp; night kneeling vpon their knees ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
roſaries, as they call them. O, what holines is there, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen God him
ſelfe dwelleth, where the holy Ghoſt the comforter abideth preſent?
Theſe thinges the world boaſteth of, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemeth. But beſide
theſe they doe not marke, how they pray with no earneſtnes of hart, howe
they teach and inſtruct no man, howe they giue nothing to any, but catch vnto
them ſelues both the blood and ſweat of the poore, and leaue true ſincere
workes vndone. This righteouſnes &amp; holines the world extolleth, which
notwithſtanding ſtincketh and is wholy vncleane before God, which he will
haue euen to be vnknowne vnto vs, yet the worlde refuſeth to admit any
other.</p>
               <p>But there is an other maner of righteouſnes then this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
God eſteemeth &amp; accepteth, which alſo we muſt conſider,<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth, of what ſort it
is.</note> now it is of this ſorte: It conſiſteth not in a graye garment,
not in a blacke or white coule, but in a pure conſcience. To wit, when I
beleeue, that Chriſt is my ſaluation, and that my workes can preuaile
nothing hereunto: but that he doth all thinges which God hath regarde vnto.
Then I ſay no more: a gray garment is holy, a red garment is prophane,
foraſmuch as I know, that not in a gray or any other garment, but in Chriſt
all thinges conſiſt. For no man can attaine to this, that a gray garment
may clenſe his hart from f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lth, or that a monaſterie may purifie it: for it is neceſſary
that God onely purifie the hart by faith, and the holy Ghoſt, as Peter
witneſſeth Act. 15. When the hart is now pure, the houſe is vnto it as
the fielde, and the fielde as the houſe: The market is as much eſteemed of
it as the Monaſterie, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe. Neither remaineth there vnto me
any worke, place, or garment, which I count prophane: for all thinges are alike
vnto me, after that holines hath fully poſſeſſed my hart. That euen God
ſayth vnto me: Thou art godly, I am thy father, thou art my ſonne. And
herein we ought to perſiſt, that we be holy, and without feare doe obey and
ſerue him. Here the title and badges <pb n="62" facs="tcp:9413:40"/> of a Chriſtian
are ſeene, &amp; this is his cogniſance, to wit, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy, he is
the Miniſter of God without feare. But what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is there which dareth
challenge to him ſelfe this title? Let one come forth, which dareth auouch
him ſelfe to be godly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, holy, and the ſeruaunt of God,
deſtitute of no good thinges either of mind or body. Now he that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
glory of theſe things, is not a Chriſtian. For of theſe thinges muſt a
ſincere Chriſtian be partaker. But what letteth that one dareth not
challenge to him ſelfe this title? Euen a timorous conſcience: for we
alwaies feele ſinne, and our life is euer fraile. I ſee nothing but an
honeſt life, although God require this alſo of vs, yet he will not be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therwith, but there is neede that there be yet a certain high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thinge, that I dare be bolde to ſay: Lorde God maker of the whole worde, I am
certaine that I am holy before thee, and am thy ſeruaunt, not for myne owne
ſake, who do as yet feele ſinnes in my ſelfe, but through Chriſt, who
hath taken away my ſinne, and made ſatisfaction for me. Theſe thinges
ſurely I ought to glory of, if I be a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But this ſeemeth difficult and hard: God admitteth no ſinne,
my fearefull and weake conſcience is againſt me. How am I his ſeruaunt,
when as notwithſtanding I feele in my ſelfe, that I ſerue the deuill, and
doe not knowe that I am holy? I ſpeake not here of the common ſort of
Chriſtians, ſuch as I, and ſuch like are: but of ſincere Chriſtians,
which haue a good conſcience, and in whoſe hartes the ſpirit of God
abideth, whoſe conſcience albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it be frayle and weake, and they feele
their ſinnes, yet they are enforced to ſay: Howſoeuer ſinne is, yet I
know no ſinne by my ſelfe, neither am I ſubiect to death and hell, and
for this cauſe they ſtriue, and at the laſt ouercome, that therefore they
would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen die, in that confidence. But I finde it farre otherwiſe, if I
ſet my life before my ſight. Here life and the word muſt be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
farre aſunder. If thou wilt conſider life, I will ſet alſo before thee
the liues of S. Peter, Paule, or Iohn, thou ſhalt finde euen them not to haue
liued without ſinne. When thou deſireſt to be holy before God,<note place="margin">We
muſt truſt, not to our life and workes, but to the mere mercy and grace of
God</note> truſt not to thy life, vnleſſe thou wilt periſh for euer.
For thou muſt truſt to onely mercy and grace, and not to life or workes,
otherwiſe thy caſe will be very ill. Wherefore our hart muſt be ſo
affected that it ſay: Lorde, if thou ſhouldeſt call me to an account, I
ſhould not be able either by life or workes to <pb n="63" facs="tcp:9413:40"/> ſtande
in thy ſight, no although I were euen Iohn the Baptiſt. Neuertheles
therefore I glory that I am godly, &amp; thy ſeruaunt, for that thou doeſt
giue vnto me continually, and alſo for that, as thou haſt promiſed to
Abraham, thou doeſt for thy Chriſts ſake, vouchſafe to ſhew thy mercy
vnto me: if ſo be that I of my ſelfe be not godly and righteous, yet he is
godly and righteous for me: If I be prophane, he is holy: if I be not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſeruaunt of God, he is the ſeruaunt of God: if I be not without feare and
careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yet he is voyd of all feare and carefulnes: that ſo I may as it
were transferre my ſelfe from my ſelfe, and perſe into him, &amp; glory,
that in Chriſt &amp; by Chriſt I am good. Thus he will haue vs to glory,
that we are godly and holy, but not by our owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for we muſt glory of
our ſelues, as of moſt deſperate wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>And that this may be plaine, marke our life, conſider our good
conuerſation and maners, weye how fooliſhly men apply them ſelues to the
Goſpell, that I am almoſt in dout, whether I ſhould preach any more or
no. For as ſoone as theſe thinges are taught in a ſermon, that
ſaluation conſiſteth not in our works or life, but in the giftes of God,
euery one is ſlow to doe good, no man will liue an honeſt life, and be any
more obedient, they falſly affirme euery where, that good workes are
inhibited. Neuertheles God requireth of vs, that we lead an honeſt life
outwardly, and he that doth not ſo, ſhall at length finde his due
puniſhment. Nowe if it happen that we liue godlily and honeſtly outwardly,
Satan by and by frameth his wickednes. Neither doe I know at this day how to
order my ſelfe in this matter, not becauſe of my owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but
becauſe of life. For if we preach of an honeſt and godly life, the worlde
by &amp; by furiouſly attempteth without iudgement,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour by their good works to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p> 
                     <p>We muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther preſume of good workes, nor neglect to
leade a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
                  </note> to build ladders to heauen: which God neither
can, neither wil by any meanes ſuffer: Againe, a diſhoneſt and
ignominious life doth not become Chriſtians, neither doth a delicate life
become them. What therefore muſt we then doe? They which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
onely to an honeſt and fayre life, it were better for them to be adulterers
and adultereſſes, and altogether to wallow in the myre. And yet
notwithſtanding God will not haue vs to lead our life filthily and
diſhoneſtly. For neither can he ſuffer that, adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thee euen vnto
hell therefore, if thou ſo doe. And if thou lead an honeſt life, thou wilt
ſticke in it, and arrogate vnto thy ſelfe, <pb n="64" facs="tcp:9413:41"/> which
againe he can not ſuffer. Thou muſt therefore ſo prouide that thou
remaine in the middle pathe, declining neither to the right hand, nor to the
left, and that thou lead a quiet, fayre, and amiable life in the ſight of the
world: which alſo may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God, and yet that thou doe not
therefore ſo greatly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it, nor count ſo of it, as though thou
doeſt merit any thing of God thereby.</p>
               <p>Thus a Chriſtian continueth the holy ſeruaunt of God
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, not by his good workes and holy life, but by the grace of
Chriſt.<note place="margin">Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our ſelues holy by our
works</note> But he that affirmeth that he is holy by his workes, is
blaſphemous againſt God, robbeth God of his honour, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt,
for whom it were better, that he were ten times an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, or an adulterer,
then that he ſhould thereby affirme him ſelfe to be a Chriſtian, yea
godly and holy: for he doth plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour Chriſt, and it is as much as
to affirme that there is no Chriſt: for he is therefore called Chriſt, for
that he is our grace, mercy, redemption, and holines. If I ſhould not
attribute to the diuine mercy, that God him ſelfe doth ſaue me, what
ſhould this be elſe, but to ſay, that he is neither holy nor bleſſed?
Wherefore if I be a Chriſtian, I muſt confeſſe, that I am holy and a
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for this cauſe, for that Chriſt him ſelfe is holy. And
albeit my conſcience doth reproue me of ſinne, yet I muſt ſtill
perſeuer in this, that his holines is greater then my ſinnes. Thus I muſt
liue honeſtly outwardly, but inwardly reſt and truſt in him alone. It
followeth moreouer how Zacharias turneth his ſpeech to the child, and
ſayth:</p>

aliue. But this Prophet doth liue euen at that tyme, when the Lord him ſelfe
commeth, and by and by followeth him. For the Goſpell was begon to be

preparation is nothing elſe, but to bring people to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde the Sauiour.
Chriſt is the grace, gift, King and horne of our ſaluation. This Lorde and
King no man receiueth, vnles he be firſt humbled, that he thinke nothing of
him ſelf. For he can not otherwiſe attaine vnto Chriſt, neither can
ſtand together, to receiue the grace of God by gift, and alſo to merit the
ſame. Iohn therefore in this part teacheth men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that they
are ſinners and altogether nothing. He now which acknowledgeth him ſelfe,
and feeleth him ſelfe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before, yea and to be nothing, well
vnderſtandeth the voice of Iohn, which is, prepare ye a way for the Lorde:
Giue place to him: He is at hande that followeth me, who is greater then I, him
ye ſhall heare, him ye ſhall obey. The other office of Iohn which
followeth, is, that he bringeth men to the knowledge of ſaluation, and
ſheweth with his finger that paſcall Lambe, that taketh away our ſinnes,
that he may faſten them to the croſſe with him ſelfe and aboliſh

commeth to paſſe without our merit: but a Mediatour commeth betwene, who

God would that ſatisfaction ſhould be made vnto him for our ſinnes, and
that his honour and lawe ſhoulde be performed, here we were able to doe
nothing. But Chriſt alone both was able, and ſatisfied for vs who of the
infinit mercy of the father, was ſent for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame cauſe, and that to vs,
that he might diſpatche it. Therefore he ſayth, Through which infinit &amp;

dout it was no merit, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnmeaſurable mercy, that Chriſt came to vs,

aboue all creatures, where nothinge is hier, but heighth alone, there is

that they are incenſed with anger againſt the Iewes, and doe inueigh

content, and thinke this to be ſufficient, euen as they are wont in lamenting
the caſe of other, to take pity <pb n="68" facs="tcp:9413:43"/> on them, and to accuſe
and condemne their aduerſaries. But that can not be called a remembring of
the paſſion of Chriſt, but rather of Iudas and Iudas his wickednes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome haue noted in their mindes diuerſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and frutes proceeding of the meditation of Chriſtes paſſion, that
ſaying which is aſcribed to Albertus being commonly in their remembrance,
that it is better to thinke vpon the paſſion of Chriſt ſuperficially or
once, then if one ſhould faſt the ſpace of a whole yeare, and daily in
praying goe ouer the whole Pſalter, &amp;c. That they follow hitherto, being
blind and iuſtly ſtumbling, contrary to the true frute of the Lordes
paſſion. Moreouer they ſeeke their owne thinges therein, and therefore
they bringe with them images, bookes, letters and croſſes. Some alſo go
ſo farre, that they thinke they ſhall make them ſelues ſafe from
waters, terrors, fire, and from all daunger, as though the Lordes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſhould be without ſuffering in them, contrary to the quality and nature
thereof.</p>

wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for him as being an innocent man, like vnto the women which followed
Chriſt from Ieruſalem, who were reprehended and admoniſhed of him, that
they ſhould weepe for them ſelues &amp; for their children.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſome ſo call to mind the paſſion of the Lord,
and ſo conſider Chriſt, that inwardly they are ſore afraid, yea their
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo or vnderſtanding is turned into a certaine aſtoniednes or
baſhfulnes.<note place="margin">How the paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt ought to

muſt needes be that there is an vnſpeakeable and a moſt ſerious and

doe good vnto him, &amp; ſuffereth and dyeth for him.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, reuolue deepely in thy minde, and dout not a whit, that
thou art he which ſo tormented Chriſt, foraſmuch as thy ſinnes 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9413:43"/> were moſt certainly the cauſe thereof. Thus S. Peter
in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Actes, did ſtrike &amp; terrifie the Iewes as it were
with a certain lightning, when as he ſayd vnto them generally: <hi>whom you
haue crucified,</hi> ſo that the very ſame day three thowſand me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were
greatly terrified, and being pricked in their hartes ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
Apoſtles: <hi>Men and brethren, what shall we doe?</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou
conſidereſt that his handes were pearſed with nayles, thinke that it was
thy worke: when thou remembreſt his crowne of thornes, perſwade thy ſelfe
that it was thy wicked co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, which cauſed it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, thinke with thy ſelfe, that whereas one thorne pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Chriſt, thou oughteſt worthely to be pricked with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thowſand
thornes, &amp; that without intermiſſion, yea &amp; much more grieuouſly:
and that whereas one nayle pearſed the hands and feete of Chriſt, thou
oughteſt to be grieued &amp; moleſted with many moe and farre more ſharpe
nayles continually, euen as it ſhall come at the laſt vnto thoſe, in
whome the paſſion of Chriſt hath not bene effectuall but fruſtrat. For
Chriſt who is the truth it ſelfe, will lye to no man, will delude no man,
and that which he attempteth muſt needes be a matter of exceeding great
impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and wonderfull high.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, ſuch feare Bernard had conceiued hereof when he
ſayd: I did play abroad in the ſtreete, and in the Kinges priuie chamber
ſentence of death was giuen vpon me. The Kinges one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſonne
hearing this, layd of his diademe &amp; came forth, clothed in ſackcloth, his
head ſprinkeled with aſhes, &amp; bare foote, weeping and crying out that
his ſeruaunt was condemned to death. I beholding him ſodenly comming forth,
am amaſed at the ſtraungenes thereof, I aske and harken after the cauſe.
What ſhall I doe? ſhall I play ſtill and delude his teares? Alas (ſayth
he) it is no time now to play, it is no time to be ſecure, when ſo weightye
a matter is in hande. So he bad the women that they ſhould not weepe for him,
but for them ſelues and for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and he adioyneth the cauſe:
<hi>For if they doe theſe thinges to a greene tree, what shal be done to the
drie?</hi> as if he ſayd: learne what ye obtaine by my paſſion, and
howſoeuer thinges fall out, yet this is true and knowne among you, that the
whelpe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſmitten, that the bandogge or maſtiue may be
terrified. So alſo the Prophet hath ſpoken: <hi>All kinreds of the earth
shall <pb n="70" facs="tcp:9413:44"/> waile before him.</hi> He ſayd not, they ſhall
bewaile him, but, <hi>they shal waile before him.</hi> Moreouer they were
ſore afraid, of whom it is before ſpoken, ſo that they ſayde vnto the
Apoſtles Act. 2: <hi>Men and brethren, what shall we doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, that this affection may be wrought in vs, the Lords
paſſion is very diligently to be conſidered of and meditated vpon,<note place="margin">By conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſtes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we ought to come to

thereof doth much conſiſt herein, that a man may come to the knowledge of
him ſelfe, and tremble and be troubled before him ſelfe: whereunto he that
doth not come, hath not yet attained vnto the due profit of the Lordes
paſſion. For the paſſion of Chriſt hath this proper and naturall
vertue, to make a man like vnto him, that euen as he was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly
tormented both in body and mind for our ſinnes: ſo we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to imitat him
muſt be afflicted in the knowledge of our ſinnes. Howbeit the matter is not
here done in many words, but in depe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cogitation and earneſt weying of
ſinnes.<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> Take a ſimilitude: as thou
haſt great cauſe to feare and tremble, if, when ſome malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is
condemned, for that he hath killed the ſonne of the King or Prince, thou in
the meane ſeaſon, ſinging and playing ſecurely as being innocent, art
terribly apprehended and conuicted, that thou dideſt ſuborne the homicide:
So thou oughteſt to become much more fearefull when thou doeſt reuolue in
thy minde the paſſion of Chriſt. For albeit the wicked Iewes be now
iudged of God and diſperſed, yet were they Miniſters of thy
tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thou for a certainty art he, which with thy ſinnes
haſt crucified and ſlayne the ſonne of God, as it hath bene ſayd.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, he that feeleth him ſelfe ſo hardned and dull, that
the paſſion of Chriſt doth not terrifie him, neither bring him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
knowledge of him ſelfe, is in an ill and lamentable caſe: for Chriſtes
paſſion is not effectuall in him. But nowe it is a harde thing for thee to
be occupied in theſe thinges,<note place="margin">What we muſt do that our
medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be frutefull.</note> and
earneſtly bent to the meditation of them: wherefore thou ſhalt pray God
that he will mollifie thy hart, and giue thee grace profitably to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
vpon the paſſion of Chriſt, becauſe it can not in any wiſe be, that
the paſſion of Chriſt ſhould be inwardly and rightly thought vpon and
conſidered of vs, vnles God inſpire it into our hartes. Yea, neither this
meditation nor any other doctrine is therefore ſet forth vnto thee, that thou
ſhouldeſt boldly ruſhe vpon it of thy ſelfe to fulfill it, but that
thou ſhouldeſt firſt aske and deſire the <pb n="71" facs="tcp:9413:44"/> grace of
God, that thou mayſt fulfil it, not by thine own ſtrength, but by Gods
grace. For hereof it commeth, that they of whom it is before ſpoken, do not
meditate on the paſſion of Chriſt aright, becauſe they deſire not
helpe of God thereunto, but rather tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vnto their owne ſtrength, and
following their owne inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meditate vpon it altogether after the
faſhion of men, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſclender and vnfrutefull maner.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, if one ſhould through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God meditate
right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the paſſion of Chriſt, by the ſpace of one day, or of one
hower, yea or the ſpace of a quarter of an hower, we would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
pronounce of him, that he hath done better, then if he had pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him ſelfe
with faſting the ſpace of a whole yeare, or had runne ouer the Pſalter
euery day. For this maner of meditation doth as it were chaunge a man, and
almoſt regenerate him a new like vnto baptiſme. Then in deede the Lordes
paſſion doth his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, due and noble office, it killeth the old Adam,
it driueth away all pleaſure, ioy and confidence, which may be had of
creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as Chriſt was forſaken of all, yea euen of his father.</p>
            <p>Eleuenthly,<note place="margin">We muſt not deſpeire or ceaſe,
though at the firſt we obtayne not that we pray for.</note> ſeeing that
ſuch a thing is not in our owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it commeth to paſſe that we doe
often times aske it, and yet do not by and by obtaine it, notwithſtanding we
muſt not therefore diſpeire or ceaſe. For that is ſometimes giuen for
which we haue not prayed, and that ſometimes is not graunted for which we
haue prayed, euen as it is the pleaſure of God, and as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be
beſt for vs, for God will haue this gift to be free &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſtraint.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, when as a man thus knowing his ſinne doth wholy
tremble in him ſelfe, he muſt eſpecially endeuour, that ſinnes doe not
ſtill remaine in his conſcience, otherwiſe meere deſperation will come
thereupon, but he muſt ſhake them of and caſt them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and
ſo vnburden his conſcience. Therefore ſee againe and againe that thou doe
not that which peruerſe men do, which within the ſecrets of their hart do
vexe &amp; diſquiet them ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſinnes, &amp;
ſtriue with them, that by good workes or ſatisfactions, by farre going on
pilgrimage, or elſe by pardons they may become ſafe, and may be made free
from ſinnes, which can not be. And (alas) ſuch a falſe confidence in
ſatisfactions and pardons hath preuailed very farre.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, then thou doeſt caſt thy ſinnes from thee vppon 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9413:45"/> Chriſt,<note place="margin">What it is to caſt our
ſinns vpon Chriſt.</note> when thou firmely beleueſt that he ſuffered
&amp; was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for thy ſinnes, and that he hath payd the ful ranſom and
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Eſaias ſayth chap. 53. <hi>The Lord hath
thrown vpon him all our ſinnes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</note> And S. Peter ſayth: <hi>who his owne ſelf
bare our ſinnes in his body on the tree.</hi> S. Paule ſayth: <hi>He hath
made him to be ſinne for vs, which knewe no ſinne, that we should be made
the righteouſnes of God in him.</hi> In theſe and ſuch like authorities
thou muſt repoſe thy hope with all boldnes, and that ſo much the more, as
thy conſcience doth more grieuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly vexe and trouble thee. But if thou
ſhalt not doe this, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeſt that thou ſhalt be quiet by thy
contrition and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then thou ſhalt neuer come vnto quietnes, but
at the laſt ſhalt fall euen into deſperation. For our ſinnes kept and
medled with within our conſcience, and ſette before the eyes of our hart,
are farre ſtronger then we, and doe liue immortally. But when as we ſee
them layd vpon Chriſt, and to be victoriouſly conquered of him by his
reſurrection, and doe confidently beleeue this, then they are dead and
brought vnto nothing. And yet being layd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, they muſt not
remayne ſo: for they are ſwallowed vppe in the triumphe of his
reſurrection. Soe ſayeth Sainct Paule: <hi>Chriſt was deliuered to deathe
for our ſinnes, and is riſen agayne for our iuſtification,</hi> that is,
he hath taken vppon him our ſinnes in his paſſion, and hath thereby payed
the raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for them, but by his reſurrection he iuſtifieth vs, and
maketh vs free from all ſinne, if ſo be that we doe beleeue this.</p>
            <p>If thou canſt not attaine vnto this faith, thou muſt as it is
a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before ſayd,<note place="margin">What we muſt doe when we can not
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto this faith, to beleue that Chriſt died for our ſinns and
roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for our iuſtification.</note> reſort vnto God by prayer,
foraſmuch as this gift is in the hand of God only, who beſtoweth it when
&amp; vpon whom it pleaſeth him. Thou maiſt alſo ſtirre vppe thy
ſelfe hereunto: firſt, not now conſidering the paſſion of Chriſt
outwardly, (for that hath nowe fulfilled his function and hath terrified thee)
but rather by pearſing inwardly and contemplating his moſt louing hart,
with how great loue towards thee it is repleniſhed, which brought him
hereunto, that he did beare thy conſcience together with thy ſinnes with
ſo great and painefull difficultie. So thy hart ſhall waxe ſweete towards
him, and the ſtrength &amp; boldnes of thy faith ſhall be increaſed. Then
hauing entred vnto the hart of Chriſt, aſcend higher euen vnto the hart of
God, and conſider that the loue of Chriſt could not haue bene ſhewed vnto
thee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <pb n="73" facs="tcp:9413:45"/> the will of God by his eternall loue had
ſo appointed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Chriſt by his loue toward thee did obey. There thou
ſhalt find a diuine hart, a good hart, a fatherly hart, and (as Chriſt
ſayth) thou ſhalt be drawne vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father by Chriſt. There thou ſhalt
vnderſtand this ſaying of Chriſt:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi>
3.16.</note> 
               <hi>So God loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne,
that whoſoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlaſting
life.</hi> For this is to know God aright, when he is vnderſtood of vs, not
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of power or wiſedom (which is a terrour vnto vs) but vnder
the name of goodnes &amp; loue. Then faith &amp; confidence may ſtand
conſtantly, &amp; man him ſelfe is as it were regenerate a new in God.</p>
            <p>When thy hart is thus eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, ſo that thou
art now become an enemy of ſinne, and that by loue and not through feare of
puniſhment, then afterward the paſſion of Chriſt ought to be an example
vnto thee in thy whole life, and is now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of in thy mind
after a farre other maner then before. For hitherto we haue conſidered it as
an outward thing which ſhould worke in vs, but now we will wey it ſo, that
ſomething is to be done of vs alſo. For examples ſake:<note place="margin">In the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſtes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we may finde reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
againſt griefe, pride, luſt, anger, enuy, ſorrow, trouble, &amp;c.</note>
when griefe or infirmity doth moleſt thee, thinke howe light theſe are
being compared to the crowne of thornes and the nayles of Chriſt. When thou
muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do or leaue of that which is grieuous vnto thee to do or leaue
of, thinke how Chriſt was taken and bound, and led vp &amp; downe. When pride
tempteth thee, conſider with thy ſelf how thy Lord was mocked, and reputed
among theeues. When luſt &amp; pleaſure pricke thee, thinke with how great
ſharpenes the tender fleſh of Chriſt was torne with whippes, and
pearſed through. When an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, enuye, deſire of reuenge moue thee, thinke
with how great teares and cryes Chriſt did praye euen for his enemies,
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom he might more iuſtly haue ſhewed him ſelfe ſharpe and
rigorous. When ſadnes or any aduerſitie whatſoeuer either corporall or
ſpirituall troubleth thee, ſtrengthen thy hart, &amp; ſay: well, why
ſhould not I alſo ſuffer a litle ſorrowfulnes, when as my Lorde did
ſweat blood in the garden for anguiſh &amp; heauines. Surely he were a
ſluggiſh and an ignominious ſeruaunt, who, his maiſter lying at the
poynt of death, would be held from him with a ſoft and eaſie bed.</p>
            <p>Lo, thus a man may find ſtrength &amp; remedie in Chriſt
againſt <pb n="74" facs="tcp:9413:46"/> all crimes and offences. This is truely in deede
to meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the paſſion of Chriſt: theſe are the frutes of the
Lordes paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which he that doth after this ſort exerciſe him
ſelfe, doth ſurely without compariſon better then if he heard all
paſſions or all ſuperſtitious Maſſes. Such alſo are called true
Chriſtians, which doe ſo repreſent the life and name of Chriſt in their
life, as S. Paule ſayth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24.</note>
               <hi>They that are Chriſtes, haue crucified the flesh with the affections and

handled in wordes and outward ſhewe, but in deede and veritie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3.</note> So S. Paule admoniſheth vs:
<hi>Conſider him that endured ſuch ſpeaking againſt of ſinners,

               <hi>Foraſmuch then as

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard in the treatiſe of the Lordes paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of Chriſtes
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but the vſe and frute of them muſt be
preached and knowen</note> that it is not ſufficient to know onely the bare
hiſtorie thereof. After the ſame maner it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough here to know, how
and when Chriſt roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but both the vſe and the profit as well of
his paſſion as of his reſurrection muſt be preached and knowne, to wit,
what Chriſt obtained for vs by them. For where the onely deede of the
hiſtorie is preached, it is a friuolous preaching and without all frute,
which both Satan and the wicked doe as well know, reade, and vnderſtand, as
we doe. But when as the vſe of <pb n="75" facs="tcp:9413:46"/> them is preached, and
whereunto they profit, that in deede is a frutefull and wholſom Sermon, and
full of ſweete conſolation. Wherefore Chriſt him ſelfe hath declared
the vſe and profit of his paſſion and reſurrection, when he thus talked
with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Matth. 28: <hi>Be not afraid: Goe and tell my brethren that
they goe into Galile, and there shal they ſee me.</hi> And this is the
firſt word, which they heare of Chriſt after his reſurrection from the
dead, whereby he confirmeth all his ſayinges, alſo all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
ſhewed vnto them before, to wit that they ſhould come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs alſo that
ſhould beleue in him, and pertaine onely to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers, for that here he
calleth not onely the Apoſtles his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but alſo all them which
beleue in him, although they doe not ſee him viſibly as the Apoſtles did.
He doth not differre vntill we pray vnto him and call vppon him, that we may be
made his brethren. Let any of vs now come forth, and boaſt of his merit, or
of the ſtrength, whereby he is able to merit any thing.<note place="margin">The
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles merited nothing at all, that Chriſt should call them his
brethren.</note> What had the Apoſtles merited? Peter denied Chriſt
thriſe. All the reſt of the Diſciples did flie away from him, they did
perſeuer and ſtand by him, euen as the hare tarieth with her yong ones, he
might haue called them runawayes, and forſakers of their ſtanding in the
middeſt of their conflict, yea traitors and wicked men, rather then brethren.
Wherefore of meere grace and mercy this worde was brought vnto them of the
Matrones, which the Apoſtles themſelues did then well perceiue, and we
alſo doe throughly feele, when we are ſet in the middes of ſinnes, and
are ouercome of damnation.</p>
            <p>This word therefore is ful of all conſolation and comfort, that
Chriſt careth for ſuch wretched men as we are, yea and that he doth call vs
his brethren. If ſo be that Chriſt be our brother, ſurely I would fayne
know what good thing we ſhall want. As therfore the caſe ſtandeth among
carnall brethren, ſo doth it ſtand here. They that are germane brethren by
conſanguinitie, do vſe goods common among them ſelues, hauing the ſame
father, the ſame inheritance, otherwiſe they were not brethren. So we
alſo poſſeſſe common good thinges with Chriſt, enioying the ſame
father, the ſame inheritance, which inheritance is not diminiſhed by
parting it, as worldly inheritances are, but is alwayes made more aboundant:
for it is a ſpirituall inheritance. A corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, when it is
diſtributed into diuers parts, is made ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <pb n="76" facs="tcp:9413:47"/> but
in this portion of the ſpirit, the caſe is ſuch, that he that hath gotten
part thereof hath obtained the whole.<note place="margin">The inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of
Chriſt.</note> What is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inheritance of Chriſt? In his power
are life and death, ſinne and grace, and whatſoeuer is contained in heauen
and in earth, his are eternall veritie, ſtrength, wiſedom, righteouſnes.
All power is giuen vnto him, he hath rule ouer all thinges, ouer hunger and
thirſt, proſperitie and aduerſitie, &amp;c. he reigneth ouer all thinges
that can be thought, whether they be in heauen or in earth, ſpirituall or
corporall, and that I may ſpeake at once: all thinges are in his power, as
well eternall thinges as temporall. Now if I ſhall cleaue vnto him by
faith,<note place="margin">What they enioy that cleaue to Chriſt by
faith.</note> I ſhall be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all his good thinges, and ſhall
not obtayne a part of the inheritance onely, but I ſhall poſſeſſe
euen with him euerlaſting wiſedom, eternall ſtrength. My belly ſhall
not be grieued with hunger, ſinnes ſhall not oppreſſe me, neither
ſhall I be afraid of the face of death, neither ſhall I dread the ſight
of Satan, neither ſhall I want the plenty of any thing that is good, euen as
he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it not. Hereby now we may eaſily vnderſtand the ſayinges
vttered commonly in the Prophets, &amp; eſpecially in the Pſalmes, as where
Dauid ſayth Pſal. 34: <hi>The Lions doe lacke and ſuffer hunger, but they
that feare the Lorde shall want no maner of thing that is good:</hi> and where
he ſayth in an other place: <hi>The Lord knoweth the wayes of the righteous,
and their inheritance shall endure for euer. They shall not be confounded in
the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous time, and in the dayes of dearth they shall haue enough.</hi> And
againe: <hi>I haue bene yonge and now am old, and yet ſaw I neuer the
righteous forſaken, nor his ſeede begging bread.</hi> All which thinges
Chriſt bringeth with him, for that we are, and are called his brethren, not
becauſe of any merit but of meere grace. If we would print theſe things in
our hart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feele them, it ſhould goe well with vs, but
they goe in at one eare and out at an other. This is that wherof S. Paule ſo
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorieth Rom. 8. <hi>As many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they
are the ſonnes of God. For ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to
feare againe: but ye haue receiued the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, whereby we cry
Abba, Father: The ſame ſpirit bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witnes with our ſpirit, that we
are the children of God: if we be children, we are alſo heires, euen the
heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt, if ſo be that we ſuffer
with him, that <pb n="77" facs="tcp:9413:47"/> we may alſo be glorified with
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer this title aſcendeth ſo high, that mans mind is not
able to comprehend it. For vnles the ſpirit the comforter did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this
grace vnto vs, no man ſhould euer be able to ſay: Chriſt is my brother.
For reaſon can not be bold ſo to ſay, albeit one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it in wordes
very often, as the new ſpirits doe. It is a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thing then that it can be
ſo ſpoken, for except the hart feele it, as it is requiſite it ſhould,
it ſhall be nothing but onely flatterie. But if thou feele it inwardly in thy
hart, it will be ſo excellent a thing vnto thee, that thou wilt much rather
ſay nothing of it, then ſpeake and talke of it, yea by reaſon of the
greatnes of ſo good a thinge, thou wilt perhaps dout as yet and be in an
vncertaintye whether it be ſo or not. They which onely cry out thus: Chriſt
is my brother, are fanatical ſpirits, who vainly pronounce words without any
frute. The caſe ſtandeth farre otherwiſe and farre more maruelouſly
with a true Chriſtian, ſo that he is thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to be amaſed,
neither dareth he either ſay or confeſſe any thing ſufficiently
thereof. Wherefore we muſt endeuour, that we doe not heare this onely with
fleſhly eares, but that we feele it in our hart, for then we will not be ſo
raſh, but we ſhall be forthwith caried into an admiration thereof. True and
ſincere Chriſtians enter into the viewing and feare of them ſelues,
thinking thus: O wretched and defiled creature, which am drowned in ſinnes,
am I now made worthy, that the ſonne of God ſhould be my brother? how doe I
miſerable wretch attayne to ſuch a thing? Thus he is by and by aſtonied,
and doth not well vnderſtand the thing. But a great ſtudie and endeuour
ſurely is required, that a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue this, yea if it were felt, as it
ought in very deede, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould forthwith dye thereupon. For he can not
vnderſtand it according to his fleſh and blood, and the hart of man in this
life is more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſtraight, then that it is able to comprehend ſo
great thinges. But in death, when the hart ſhall be ſtretched out, then I
ſay we ſhall trie what we haue heard by the word.</p>
            <p>In the Goſpel of Iohn chap. 20. Chriſt doth farre more
plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare vnto Marie Magdalen this vſe and frute both of his death and
alſo of his reſurrection, when he ſayth: <hi>Goe vnto my brethren and
tell them: I aſcende vnto my father and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnto my God &amp; your
God,</hi> this is one of the moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table places whereof we may glory
and boaſt. As though Chriſt <pb n="78" facs="tcp:9413:48"/> ſhould ſay: Marie, get
thee hence and declare vnto my Diſciples which did flee from me, which haue
throughly deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eternall condemnation, that this
reſurrection of myne is for their good, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue by my
reſurrection brought the matter to that paſſe, that my father is their
father, and my God is their God. They are but a fewe &amp; verie ſhort wordes
in deede but they containe great matter in them, namely, that we haue as great
hope &amp; confidence repoſed in God, as his owne ſonne him ſelfe. Who
can comprehend ſuch exceeding ioye, I will not ſay, vtter it? that a
wretched and defiled ſinner may be bolde to call God his father &amp; his God
euen as Chriſt him ſelfe. The author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues chap.
2. did well remember the wordes of the Pſalme, and weied with him ſelfe how
it ſpeaketh of Chriſt, who, as he ſayth, is not aſhamed to call the
beleeuers, brethren, ſaying: <hi>I will declare thy name vnto my brethren, in
the middeſt of the Church or congregation will I ſing prayſes to
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any worldly Prince or noble man ſhould humble him ſelfe
ſo low, that he would ſay to a theefe or robber, or to one that is infected
with the french pocks: thou art my brother, it would be a certaine notable
thing which euery one would maruell at. But whereas this king which ſitteth
in glory at the right hand of his father, ſayth of ſome poore man: this is
my brother, that no man layeth vp in the boſome of his breſt, neither doth
any man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it in his mind, wherein notwithſtanding our chiefe
comfort and confidence conſiſteth againſt ſinne, death, the deuils,
hell, the law, and againſt all ſiniſter ſucceſſe of thinges as well
of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as of the mind. Moreouer, foraſmuch as we are fleſh &amp;
blood, and therefore ſubiect to all kindes of aduerſitie, it followeth,
that the caſe ſhould ſtand ſo alſo with our brother, otherwiſe he
ſhould not be like vnto vs in all thinges. Wherefore, that he might be made
conformable and like vnto vs,<note place="margin">Chriſt like vnto vs in all
thinges except ſinne</note> he taſted and had experience of all things euen
as we haue, ſinne only excepted, that he might be our true brother, and
exhibite him ſelf openly vnto vs. Which the Epiſtle to the Hebrues doth
liuely ſet forth chap. 2. where it ſayth: <hi>Foraſmuch then as the
children are partakers of flesh &amp; blood, he alſo him ſelfe likewiſe
tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had the
power of death, that is, the deuil, &amp; that he might deliuer all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
for feare <pb n="79" facs="tcp:9413:48"/> of death were all their life time ſubiect to
bondage. For he tooke not on him the Angells nature, but he tooke on him the
ſeede of Abraham. VVherefore in all thinges it behoued him, to be made like
vnto his brethren, that he might be mercifull, &amp; a faithfull hie Prieſt
in thinges concerning God, that he might make reconciliation for the ſinnes
of the people. For in that he ſuffered and was tempted, he is able to
ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> The profit,<note place="margin">The frute

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His text is full of conſolation, which in a goodly parable
ſetteth forth Chriſt our Lord, &amp; teacheth what maner of perſon he is,
what be his workes, and of what affection he is toward men. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles it can
not be vnderſtood, but by comparing togither light and darkenes, day and
night, that is, a good and an euill ſhepeheard, as the Lord alſo doth in
this place.</p>
            <p>Ye haue nowe oftentimes heard, that God hath inſtituted and
ordeined in the worlde two maner of preachings:<note place="margin">The
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the law.</note> One is, when the word of God is preached, which
ſayth Exod. 20: <hi>Thou shalt haue none other gods before me.</hi> Alſo:
<hi>Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, Thou shalt not
ſteale,</hi> &amp; doth alſo threaten, that he which doth not keepe thoſe
precepts ſhall dye. But that preaching doth iuſtifie no man. For although a
man be thereby compelled to ſhew him ſelfe godly outwardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men,
notwithſtanding inwardly his hart is offended at the law,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell.</note> and had leuer there were
no lawe. The other miniſterie of the word is the Goſpell, which ſheweth
where that is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which the lawe requireth, it neither vrgeth nor
threatneth, but allureth men gentlely, it ſayth not: doe this or that, but it
ſayth thus: Goe too, I will ſhew where thou mayſt receiue and take,
whereby thou mayſt become righteous: Behold, here is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he
will giue it thee. Wherfore theſe two diſagree one with an other, as much
as to receiue and giue, to exact and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And this difference is to be well
vnderſtood and marked. To hardened and vntractable men,<note place="margin">To
whom the law muſt be preached</note> which feele not the Goſpell, the lawe
is to be preached, and they are ſo long to be vrged, till they begin to be
mollified and humbled, and doe acknowledge their diſeaſe, which when it is
done, there is then place to begin <pb n="81" facs="tcp:9413:49"/> to preach the
Goſpell. Theſe two ſortes of preachinges were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ordayned
of God, beſides theſe there are other which were not ordayned of God, but
are traditions inuented by men, ordained of the Pope and his Prelats, wherewith
they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the Goſpell. Theſe are not worthy to be called either
ſhepeherds or hirelings, but they are thoſe which Chriſt calleth theeues,
robbers and wolues. For if we will rule and guide men rightly and well, that
muſt needes be done by the worde of God: whereby if it be not done, we
ſurely labour in vaine. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Chriſt entreateth here of that
ſecond miniſterie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, and deſcribeth of what ſorte it is: he
maketh him ſelfe the chiefe, yea the onely ſhepeheard, for that which he
doth not feede, doth ſurely remayne vnfed.</p>
            <p>Ye haue heard that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt after his
paſſion and death was rayſed from the dead, is entred into, and placed in
immortalitie, not that he might ſit idle in heauen, and reioyce with him
ſelfe, but that he might receiue a kingdom, might exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the function of a
gouernour and king, of whom all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yea &amp; the whole Scripture
doe ſpeake very much. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is to be acknowledged to be vnto vs
continually a preſent gouernour and ruler, neither muſt we thinke that he
is idle in heauen, but that he doth from aboue both fill and gouerne all
thinges as Paule ſayth Epheſ. 4. who hath an eſpeciall care of his
kingdome, which is the Chriſtian faith, hereupon it muſt needes be, that
his kingdom doe floriſh amonge vs here in earth. Of this kingdom we haue
elſewhere ſayd, that it is ſo ordeyned,<note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
Chriſt increaſeth, not by force and power, but by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the
Goſpell.</note> that we all encreaſe euery day and become purer, and that
it is not gouerned at all by any force or power, but by outward prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
alone, that is, by the Goſpell. And this Goſpell commeth not from man, but
Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe brought it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward put it into the hartes
of the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, that they might comprehend it,
and into their mouthes that they might ſpeake and publiſh it. Hereby is his
kingdom gouerned, wherein he ſo reigneth, that all the power thereof
conſiſteth in the word of God. Now whoſoeuer ſhall heare &amp; beleeue
this,<note place="margin">The force &amp; efficacie of the word of God.</note>
doe pertaine to this kingdome. Moreouer this worde is afterward made ſo
effectuall, that it giueth all thinges which are neceſſary to man, &amp;
bringeth a certain abundance of all good things which may be had. For it is the
power of God which is able to ſaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <pb n="82" facs="tcp:9413:50"/> one that
beleeueth, as Paul witneſſeth Rom. 1: When thou beleueſt that Chriſt
died for thee, to deliuer thee from all euill, &amp; ſo cleaueſt vnto the
worde, it is ſure and certaine that no creature is able to ouerthrow thee.
For as none is able to ouerthrow the word, ſo none is able to hurt thee, when
thou ſtickeſt vnto it. By the word therefore thou dooſt ouercome ſinne,
death, Satan, hell, and thither thou muſt reſort and flie, where the word
is, that is, to eternall peace, ioy, and life, and briefly, thou ſhalt be
made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all ſuch good things as are promiſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word.
Wherfore the gouernment of this kingdom is maruelous: the word is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
&amp; preached through the whole world, but the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is very
ſecret, neither doth any man marke that it is ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, &amp; that it
ſo much profiteth them that beleue: howbeit it muſt be felt and taſted in
the hart. We therfore of the miniſterie are able to performe no more, then
that we are the mouth of our Lorde Chriſt, and the inſtrument whereby he
openly preacheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word. For he ſuffereth the word to be publiſhed
abroad, that euery one may heare it. But faith maketh that it is felt inwardly
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, yea and it is the ſecret worke of Chriſt, whenſoeuer any
knoweth that it is his duety, and is alſo willing to doe according to his
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine will and good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But that this may be the better perceiued, we wil now intreat of
our text, wherein Chriſt firſt ſayth: <hi>I am the good shepeherd.</hi>
And what is a good ſhepeheard? A good ſhepeherd, ſayth Chriſt, giueth
his life for his ſheepe. And I leaue my life for my ſheepe. Here the Lord
declareth what his kingdom is, bringing a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parable of the ſheepe. Ye
knowe that it is a beaſt of all liuing creatures moſt fooliſh and moſt
ſimple, ſo that thereupon it is commonly ſpoken as a prouerb, if we haue
to ſpeake of a ſimple one: He is a ſheepe. Neuertheles it is of that
nature more then other liuing creatures, that it quickly knoweth the voyce of
his ſhepeheard, neither followeth it any beſide his owne ſhepeheard,
being alwaies of that qualitie that it cleaueth to him, and ſeeketh for helpe
of him alone, being not able to helpe it ſelfe, neither to feede it ſelfe,
neither to heale it ſelfe, nor keepe it ſelfe from the wolues, but doth
wholy conſiſt in the helpe of an other. Chriſt therefore bringeth the
qualitie and nature of the ſheepe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a parable, and transformeth
him ſelfe into a ſheepeheard, whereby he doth very well ſhewe, what his
kingdome is, and <pb n="83" facs="tcp:9413:50"/> wherein it conſiſteth, and his
meaning is this: My kingdom is nothing els, but that I may feede ſheepe, that
is, miſerable, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and wretched men in the earth, which doe well perceiue
and feele, that they haue no helpe or counſell any other where, but in me
alone.</p>
            <p>But that we may declare this more plainely, we will adde hereunto
a place out of Ezechiel chap. 34. which ſpeaketh of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſhepeheards that
doe contrary vnto Chriſt, &amp; ſayth: <hi>Ought not the flockes ſuffer
them ſelues to be fed of the shepeheards? VVhy therefore doe you feede
yourſelues?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euill shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards how they behaue them
ſelues and gouerne their flocke.</note> 
               <hi>Ye haue eaten the milke of the
sheepe, ye haue clothed your ſelues with the woll, the beſt fed ye haue
ſlaine, but my flocke haue ye not fed. The weake haue ye not ſtrengthned,
the ſicke haue ye not healed, the broken haue ye not bound together, the
driuen away haue ye not brought againe, the loſt haue ye not ſought, but
with force and crueltie haue ye ruled them. And now my sheepe are ſcattered,
for that they are deſtitute of shepeheards, yea all the beaſtes of the
field deuour them, and they are diſperſed ouer all mountaines, and ouer the
whole earth.</hi> That which he here ſayth is well to be marked: his very
meaning in this place is, that he will haue the weake, ſicke, broken,
abiects, and loſt, to be ſtrengthned, healed, cured, ſought, not
ſpoyled and deſtroyed. Theſe thinges ye ought to doe, ſayth he to the
ſhepeheards, but ye haue do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> none of them. Wherefore I my ſelfe (as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſayth)
will deale thus with my ſheepe: <hi>That which is loſt will I ſeeke
againe, that which is driuen away will I bringe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and to that which is
not well will I giue a remedie and heale it.</hi> Here thou ſeeſt that the
kingdom of Chriſt is ſuch as hath to doe with thoſe that be weake,
diſeaſed and broken, &amp; hath care of them to helpe them. The preaching
whereof in deede is very full of comfort, but this is wanting in vs, that we
doe not throughly feele our miſerie and weakenes, which if we felt, we would
forthwith runne vnto him. But how did thoſe ſhepeheards behaue them
ſelues? They ruled in rigour and ſtraightly exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obedience of the lawe.
Moreouer, they added their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as they doe alſo at this day,
which if they be not kept, they cry out, and condemne him that
tranſgreſſeth them, ſo that they doe nothing elſe, but vrge more and
more and commaund their owne inuentions. But this is not to feede wel or to
gouerne <pb n="84" facs="tcp:9413:51"/> a ſoule, as Chriſt ſayth, who him ſelf is
not ſuch a ſhepeheard, for by ſuch maner of feeding none is holpen, but
the ſheepe are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt as we ſhall vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>Now we will handle the place of the Prophet in order. Firſt he
ſayth that the weake ſheepe are to be ſtrengthned,<note place="margin">Weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences how they muſt be handled.</note> that is,
the conſciences which are weake in faith, and haue a ſorrowfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and are of a faint courage, are not to be enforced, that it ſhould be ſayd
vnto them: This thou muſt doe, thou muſt be ſtrong. For if thou be ſo
weake, thou art ordayned to eternall puniſhment: This is not to ſtrengthen
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weake. Thus ſaith Paule Rom. 14: <hi>Him that is weake in the faith
receiue vnto you, &amp; entangle not conſciences.</hi> And by &amp; by after
he addeth Rom. 15: <hi>VVe which are ſtronge ought to beare the infirmities
of the weake.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not to be ſeuerely compelled, but to be
comforted, that although they be weake, they may not therefore deſpeire, for
after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ards they ſhall
become ſtronger. Eſaias the Prophet did thus foreſpeake of Chriſt cap.
42: <hi>A brooſed reede shall he not breake, &amp; the ſmoking flax shall
he not quenche.</hi> The broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reede ſignifieth miſerable, weake, and
brooſed conſciences, which are eaſily ſo ſhaken, that they tremble,
and loſe hope and truſt in God. With theſe God doth not forthwith deale
rigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and after a violent maner, but he dealeth gentely with them,
leſt he breake them. Moreouer the ſmoking flax, which doth as yet burne a
litle, &amp; nouriſheth more ſmoke then fire,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e the ſame conſciences,
which ought not againe to deſpeire, for he wil not vtterly extinguiſh them,
but alwayes kindle them, and more and more ſtrengthen them. Which truely to
him that knoweth it, is a great comfort. Wherefore he which doth not gentlely
handle weake conſciences after this ſort, doth not without dout execute the
office of a true ſhepeheard.</p>
            <p>Afterward the Prophet ſayth: <hi>That which was diſeaſed, ye
ought to haue ſuccoured.</hi> Who are thoſe diſeaſed ones? They which
in their maner of liuing, and in their outward works haue certain diſeaſes,
and vices. The firſt pertaineth to the conſcience when as it is weake: the
other to the maners or conditions of life, when as any being caried with a
wilfull mind and wayward braine, doth offend here and there, to wit by wrath
&amp; other fooliſh doings, as euen the Apoſtles fel ſometimes
grieuouſly. Such as are ſo vitious in the ſight of men, that they are an
offence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <pb n="85" facs="tcp:9413:51"/> and are iudged obſtinate and
wayward, God will not haue to be reiected and deſpeired of. For his kingdom
is not ordered after ſuch a maner, that the ſtronge and whole onely
ſhould liue therein (which pertaineth to the life to come) but Chriſt is
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet in it, that he may haue a care of ſuch &amp; helpe them.
Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore albeit we are ſo weake and ſicke, notwithſtanding we muſt not
ſo deſpeire, that we ſhould ſay, that we are not in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
Chriſt, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more we feele our diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The more we
feele our ſelues diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter cauſe we haue to flie vnto
Chriſt.</note> ſo much the more we muſt come vnto him, for he therefore
is at hande that he may remedie and heale vs. Now if thou be weake and
oppreſſed with faintnes, feeling great affliction, hereby thou haſt
gotten a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion to goe vnto him, &amp; to ſay on this maner:
Moſt ſweete Chriſt, I therefore come vnto thee becauſe I am a ſinner,
that thou maiſt helpe and iuſtifie me: yea very neceſſitie doth compell
thee hereunto. For the greater thy diſeaſe is, ſo much more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is
it for thee to be healed. And Chriſt him ſelfe requireth the ſame of vs,
and doth allure vs to come vnto him boldly and chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But others which
are not ſuch ſhepeheards, do thinke that they ſhall make men righteous,
if they exact much of them and vrge them much, whereby they onely make that
which is euill worſe, as we ſee it to be done at this day, whereas it is
come to that diſorder, that all thinges are moſt miſerably brought out of
courſe, as in this place the Prophet ſayth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The broken haue ye not bound togither.</hi> To be broken is,
as when ones legge is broken, or a wound ſome where elſe giuen him. That
is, when as a Chriſtian is not onely weake and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he
ſtumbleth ſometime, but alſo runneth into ſo great tentations, that he
breaketh ſome part,<note place="margin">They which fall ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly that
they euen deny the Goſpel, muſt not be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpeired of.</note> and
ſo is brought to that paſſe, that he falleth and denieth the Goſpell,
after the maner of Peter, who did forſweare Chriſt. Now if any ſhould
ſo ſtumble, that he ſhould be compelled to goe backe, &amp; be vtterly
caſt downe in minde, neuertheles we muſt not as yet caſt him of, as
though he did neuer any more pertaine to the kingdom of Chriſt: for we muſt
leaue Chriſtes propertie to him ſelf, that his kingdom may remayne vnto him
ſelfe meere grace and mercy, whoſe deſire is to helpe them onely, which
are grieued with their calamitie and miſerie, and doe greatly deſire to be
deliuered from it. That his kingdom may altogither abound with comfort, and he
him ſelfe be the comfortable and gentle ſhepeheard, which prouoketh and 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9413:52"/> allureth euery one to come vnto him. And all this is done
by the Goſpell, whereby the weake are to be ſtrengthned, the ſicke to be
healed. For it is ſuch a word as is fit for all diſtres of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
giuing aboundant comfort to all, that none diſpeire although he be a great
ſinner. Chriſt therfore alone is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good ſhepeheard, which healeth all
ſortes of diſeaſes, and helpeth them that are fallen: which he that doth
not, is not a ſhepeheard.</p>
            <p>The Prophet thus goeth forward: <hi>That which was driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
ye haue not brought againe.</hi> What is that that is driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? The
deſpiſed ſoule, which is ſo ſcorned and contemned, that it is thought
to be done in vaine, whatſoeuer Chriſtian doctrine is beſtowed vpon it.
Notwithſtanding Chriſt doth not yet ſuffer, that it ſhould be dealt
roughly with. His kingdom is not compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſo ſtraight boundes,
that onely the ſtronge, whole and perfect doe floriſh therein, for this
pertaineth to the heauenly life to come, now in this his kingdom onely grace
and ſweetnes muſt abound. As God promiſed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of Iſraell
Exod. 3. that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> appointed land of Canaan ſhould flow only w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> milk &amp;
hony, euen as Paule 1. Cor. 12. affirmeth, that vpon thoſe members of the
body, which we thinke more vnhoneſt, we put more honeſtie on.</p>
            <p>He concludeth: <hi>The loſt haue ye not ſought.</hi> That is
loſt which ſeemeth to be condemned,<note place="margin">They which ſeeme
euen paſt hope muſt not be quite caſt of.</note> of the returne whereof
there is ſcarce any hope. Of which ſort in the Goſpell were Publicanes
&amp; harlots, and at this day they, who haue not ſo much as a ſparke of
godlines, but are vntractable and vnruly. Neither are they notwithſtanding to
be left, but all meanes are to be aſſayed that at the laſt they may be
reclaimed and brought againe into the right way. Which S. Paule eftſoones
did, as when he deliuered two of this ſort vnto Satan, 1. Tim. 1. <hi>I haue
deliuered them vnto Satan that they might learne not to blaſpheme.</hi> And
1. Cor. 5. <hi>I haue determined,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>to deliuer them to Satan
for the deſtruction of the flesh, that the ſpirit may be ſaued in the day
of the Lorde Ieſus.</hi> Them he caſt of as condemned, and yet
notwithſtanding did not deſpeire of them. Chriſt therefore is ſo to be
preached, that he reiecteth no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> although he be weake, but that he willingly
receiueth, comforteth and ſtrengthneth euery man, ſo that he alwayes
appeareth to be the good ſhepeheard. Hereupon it commeth to paſſe, that
men willingly reſort vnto him, and that it is no neede any more to compell
them. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell <pb n="87" facs="tcp:9413:52"/> ſo allureth, and maketh them
willing,<note place="margin">The Goſpel allureth vs with loue &amp; pleaſure
to come vnto Chriſt.</note> that they come with a certaine loue and
pleaſure, and with all boldnes, Whereupon a deſire and loue vnto Chriſt
is increaſed in them, ſo that they doe any thing willingly, who before were
to be vrged and compelled. If we be conſtrayned, we doe grudgingly &amp;
vnwillingly, which God plainly abhorreth. But when as I ſhall perceiue that
God dealeth ſo louingly and gentlely with me, my hart is as it were
rauiſhed, ſo that I can not ſtay my ſelfe, but I muſt euen runne vnto
him, leauing all other things, wherupon afterward all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ioy
enſueth vnto me.</p>
            <p>Now conſider how great an euill it is, when one iudgeth an
other. The kingdom of Chriſt, as we haue heard, is ſo ordeined, that it
healeth and iuſtifieth onely ſicke and miſerable conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
wherefore all they are farre deceiued, which haue regard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſtronge
and whole. It is great therefore and very effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall knowledge whereby
Chriſt is well knowne. It is graffed in vs by nature to be altogither euill
and wicked, &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we would haue euery one to be
honeſt, we earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſtronge Chriſtians, not looking
therewithall to the ſicke and weake, thinking them not to be Chriſtians, if
they are not ſtronge, and iudge others euill, if they be not altogither holy,
when as we our ſelues in the meane ſeaſon exceede the reſt in
naughtines. Now the cauſe hereof is our moſt corrupt nature,<note place="margin">Our corrupt nature and blind reaſon cauſe vs to erre &amp;
iudge amiſſe.</note> &amp; our blind reaſon, which will meaſure the
kingdom of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her owne opinion, whereby it thinketh that thoſe
things are vncleane before God, which ſeeme vncleane vnto it ſelf,
wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that opinion muſt be remoued out of our minde. For if thou haſt
very much regard thereunto, thou ſhalt at the laſt come into the mind to
thinke: alas, what ſhal become of me, if all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt be ſuch,
namely, ſtronge, whole, and godly? When ſhal I once attayne ſo farre? And
ſo thou ſhalt bringe thy ſelfe into ſuch a perplexitie, that thou
ſhalt hardely euer attayne vnto true comfort and ioye. Thou therefore muſt
be ſo affected, that thou ſay: Moſt gracious Ieſu, although I finde my
ſelfe altogether weake, diſeaſed, and in a wretched ſtate, yet I will
not therefore caſt of all hope, but wil flie vnto thee, that thou mayſt
ſuccour me, For thou onely art the ſhepeheard, &amp; the good ſhepeheard,
ſuch a one I am perſwaded that thou art, wherfore I will not deſpeire or
be diſcouraged, although I come vnto thee being voyde of <pb n="88" facs="tcp:9413:53"/>
workes. We muſt therefore beſtow our diligence that we may wiſely &amp;
well know Chriſt, that in his kingdom onely the weake and diſeaſed are
conuerſant, and that it is nothing elſe, but as it were an hoſpitall,
wherein onely the ſicke and feeble doe lie, of whom a care muſt be had. But
few men haue this knowledge, for this wiſedom is exceeding hard to be
attayned vnto, ſo that it is wanting euen vnto them ſometime, who haue the
Goſpel and the ſpirite, neither can any wiſedome come vnto men which is
greater then it. Wherfore, albeit men looke into the Scripture, which ſetteth
forth the kingdome of Chriſt, affirming it to be moſt precious, neuertheles
they haue not ſuch a care what the wordes ſignifie, neither doe they marke
that true wiſedom is hidden therein, which excelleth our wiſedom by many
degrees. For it is not Chriſtian wiſedom to haue to doe with men which are
accounted wiſe, and ſkilfull, and to make mention, and talke of them,<note place="margin">Chriſtian wiſedom is occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vnwiſe.</note> but
to be occupied among the vnwiſe and them that lack vnderſtanding, not that
delight &amp; pleaſure ſhould be taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that they may come
from ſinne and fooliſhnes to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and ſound vnderſtanding.
Hereof it appeareth that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wiſedom doth conſiſt in this, not
that we looke aloft, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe thinges which are high and
wiſe, and behold and ſee our ſelues in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were in a glaſſe,
but that we looke to thoſe things that are belowe, &amp; marke that which is
humble &amp; fooliſh. He which knoweth this, let him giue thankes vnto God.
For by this knowledge he becommeth ſuch a one as is able to prepare and apply
him ſelfe to euery thing which is in the world. But ye ſhall finde many,
yea euen among them that preach the Goſpell, which are not yet come thus
farre. Hitherto we haue bene ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed &amp; accuſtomed, that none
muſt come vnto Chriſt, before he be altogether cleane, thou muſt
therefore forſake that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thou maiſt attaine to true
vnderſtanding, that thou maiſt knowe Chriſt aright, howe he is the true
and good ſhepeheard, whereof we haue heard ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Nowe he compareth the good ſhepeheard with the euill, or
hireling, and ſayth: <hi>A good shepeheard giueth his life for the sheepe:
but an hireling, &amp; he which is not the shepeheard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the sheepe are
his owne, ſeeth the wolfe comming, &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the sheepe, &amp; the wolfe
catcheth &amp; ſcattereth the sheepe. So the hireling fleeth becauſe he is
an hireling, &amp; careth not for <pb n="89" facs="tcp:9413:53"/> the sheepe.</hi> It is
true in deede that Chriſt is properly the onely ſhepeheard, euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
name of Chriſt doth belong to him alone. yet he communicateth the ſame vnto
vs, that we alſo may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians. So although he be the onely
ſhepeheard, yet he imparteth the ſame name to them that be of the
miniſterie. After the ſame maner Matth. 23. he forbiddeth, that we call no
man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the earth, foraſmuch as there is one onely our father, which
is in heauen, notwithſtanding Paule calleth him ſelfe the father of the
Corinthians 1. Cor. 4. when he ſayth: <hi>In Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus I haue
begotten you through the Goſpell.</hi> So therefore it ſeemeth as though
God alone would haue the name of a father, and in the meane ſeaſon
notwithſtanding he graunteth the ſame name to men, that they alſo may be
fathers, howbeit that they haue not of them ſelues but by Chriſt. Euen as
we are called Chriſtians, becauſe we haue nothing of our ſelues, but for
that all thinges are giuen vnto vs through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, <hi>the hireling,</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>which is
not the shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, neither the sheepe are his owne, when he ſeeth the wolfe
comming, leaueth the sheepe &amp; fleth, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The
hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling when the wolfe commeth leaueth the ſheepe.</note> This ſurely is
a hard ſaying, that they which truely preach the Goſpel, and ſtrengthen
&amp; heale the ſheepe, neuertheles at the laſt doe ſuffer the ſheepe
to be caught and torne in peeces, and doe then flie away, when the ſheepe
haue neede of greateſt helpe. As long as the wolues doe not appeare, they do
their dutie carefully &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, but as ſoone as they ſee the wolfe
breake in, they forthwith leaue the ſheepe. If they then haue fed them well,
that they be fat, ſtrong, &amp; whole, they are the better liked of the
wolues, for whome they haue fed them. But what is the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meaning of this
parable? The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſt is this: In my kingdome (which conſiſteth
in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that the weake be ſtrengthned, the ſicke healed,
the faynt harted encouraged) the holy croſſe ſhall not be wanting.<note place="margin">The croſſe accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching of the
Goſpell.</note> For when it is preached, that Chriſt only, whoſe ſilly
ſheepe we are, hath care of vs, ſtrengthneth, healeth, and helpeth vs,
&amp; that our owne ſtrength and our owne workes are of no importance at all,
(whereby all workes of the world, and the diuerſe ſortes of worſhipping
God which it inuenteth are vtterly diſallowed) the world ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abide ſuch
maner of preaching, ſo that it is a natural propertie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, to
bring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it as vnſeparably acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, &amp; he that
will vnfeinedly profes it before the world, <pb n="90" facs="tcp:9413:54"/> muſt needes
yeld him ſelfe to beare perſecution. Foraſmuch as the caſe ſtandeth
thus, it is not hard to perceiue how great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwene the
true ſhepeheards and the hirelinges. He that is an hireling preacheth the
Goſpell as long as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported among men to be a learned,<note place="margin">The hireling how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haueth him ſelfe.</note> godly &amp; holy
man. But when as he is reproued or ſet vpon as an heretike and wicked fellow,
or moued to make a recantation, then he either recanteth, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him
ſelfe to his feete, leauing the miſerable ſheepe alone without a
ſhepeheard, then their caſe becommeth worſe then it was before. What doth
it then auaile the ſheepe if they were wel fed before?<note place="margin">What
the true shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard doth,</note> If they were true ſhepeheardes, they would
ſpend their life before they woulde ſo leaue the ſheepe to the iawes of
the wolues, and would be ready alwayes to offer their necke to the axe for the
Goſpells ſake. They therefore are neuer good ſhepeheards, which ſo
preach the Goſpell, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by get vnto them ſelues honour,
riches, and profit, without all dout they are hirelings, who ſeeke after
their owne thinges euen in ſound doctrine, yea and in the word of God.
Wherefore they abide no longer, then while they may haue honour, praiſe &amp;
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie thereby, but as ſoone as the wolfe commeth, goe backe, denye the
worde, and get them ſelues away, leauing the ſheepe, which very earneſtly
ſeeke for paſture and their ſhepeheard, who may keepe them from the
iniurie of the wolues, but that good ſhepeheard can no where be found, who
flieth away euen at that time, when the ſheepe haue moſt neede of a
defender and ſtrengthner.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſhall happen to vs in time to come, when we ſhall
once begin to be touched in deede. Then the Preachers will ſhut their
mouthes, and prouide for their ſafetie by flying, and the ſheepe ſhall be
miſerably diſperſed, ſo that one ſhall be caried this way, an other
that way. God graunt that ſome of them may ſtand valiantly in defenſe of
the Goſpell, and ſpende their blood, if the caſe ſo require in
deliuering their ſheepe. Thus Chriſt hath painted forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hirelings in
their colours, who thus ſayth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer: <hi>I am that good shepeheard, and
knowe mine, and am knowne of mine.</hi> Theſe wordes doe containe much, I
ſhoulde ſpend ouer much time, if I ſhould handle them ſeuerally. He
ſpeaketh here of the peculiar dutie that belongeth to him ſelfe. I know my
ſheepe, ſayth he, and they againe know me. Nowe the <pb n="91" facs="tcp:9413:54"/>
ſumme is this: Chriſt knoweth vs to be his ſheepe, &amp; we againe know
him to be our ſhepeheard. He knoweth vs to be ſuch ſheepe as are weake
and diſeaſed, which he doth not caſt of, but hath a care of them, and
healeth them, although they be ſo diſeaſed, that all the worlde thinketh
that they are not his ſheepe, and this in deede is the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
world. But Chriſt doth not ſo know them, neither doth he greatly regard
what maner of ones they be, but conſidereth whether they be ſheepe. They
therefore are the true ſhepeheards, who following Chriſt, doe ſo know
their ſheepe, that they looke vnto the perſons, not to the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>My father knoweth me, ſayth Chriſt,<note place="margin">The
world knoweth not Chriſt.</note> but the world knoweth me not. When as
therefore the howre ſhall come, that I ſhal die an ignominious death vpon
the croſſe, all with one voice will cry out: was this the ſonne of God?
he muſt needes be a condemned man, and giuen vp vnto Satan, both in ſoule
and alſo in body. So the world will conſider and know me. But my father
will ſay in this ſort: this is my welbeloued ſonne, my king and Sauiour.
He beholdeth not my affliction, my woundes, my croſſe &amp; death, but he
conſidereth my perſon, that is, me very ſelfe. Wherefore if I were in the
middeſt of hell, or in the iawes of Satan, yet I ſhould come out againe,
for the father will not forſake me. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I know my ſheepe, and they
knowe me. They are certaine that I am a good ſhepeheard, they know me,
therefore they come to me for ſuccour, and cleaue vnto me, neither doth it
any thinge feare them, that they are ſubiect to manifold infirmities and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, they knowe very well that I would haue ſuch maner of ſheepe
to reſort vnto me. <hi>Other sheepe I haue alſo, which are not of this
folde: them alſo muſt I bringe and they shall heare my voice, and there
shall be one shepefold, &amp; one shepeheard.</hi> Some haue ſo handled this
place, that they affirme it ſhall be fulfilled before the latter day, when
Antichriſt, Iohn, and Helias ſhall come. Which is flatly againſt the
truth, and forged of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that men might beleue, that the whole world
ſhall at the laſt become Chriſtian. Which Satan therefore did that he
might darken the ſound doctrine, that we might neuer rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it. Beware therefore of this deluſion. For by and by after the aſcenſion
of Chriſt this was done and fulfilled, and is yet at this day fulfilled. As
ſoone as the Goſpell was publiſhed, it was preached to the Iewes, and
this people was the ſhepefold. Now <pb n="92" facs="tcp:9413:55"/> he ſayth, that he
hath certaine other ſheepe alſo, which are not of this fold, which alſo
he muſt gather together, whereby he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Goſpell muſt be
preached to the Gentiles that they alſo may beleue in Chriſt, that of the
Iewes and Gentiles may be made one Church. Which he performed afterward by the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who preached the Goſpell to the Gentiles, and brought them to
the faith. So there is now one body, one Church, one faith, one hope, one loue,
one baptiſme, and ſo of the like, which continueth at this day, and ſhal
ſo continue euen to the ende of the world. Wherfore doe not ſo vnderſtand
it as though all men ſhall beleue in Chriſt, for the croſſe muſt
alwayes be borne of vs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the greateſt parte is alwayes of that
faction, which perſecuteth Chriſtians. The Goſpell alſo muſt be
continually preached, that alwayes ſome may be brought to Chriſtianitie.

right deſerueth to be called chriſtian doctrine, to wit of grace and
forgiuenes of ſinnes, ſet downe againſt the doctrine of the law, and of
workes. But it is a very ſhamefull thinge, that a ſermon ſo excellent,
and repleniſhed with ſo great comfort and ioy, ſhould be heard of a man
that is wicked &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of the word of God. This is much more
miſerable, that all thinke they haue ſo ſoone throughly learned it, to

there is nothing in it, which he doth not perfectly vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and that
there is no neede to ſpend any more ſtudie in learning it. Although it be
not grieuous to God him ſelfe, neither doth it yrke or wearie him, euery
yeare repeating it, or rather euery day exerciſing it, as though he knewe to
preach nothing elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnſkilfull and ignorant of all other kind of

attaine to the knowledge of the chiefeſt doctrine, that forthwith it is
wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſom and tedious vnto vs to repeat it, whereby all pleaſure and loue
of the worde of God dieth and is extinguiſhed in vs.</p>
            <p>But before I declare the article or chiefe point here taught, I
thinke it good, that the beginning of this chapter be diligently conſidered,
which S. Luke ſetteth in ſteede of a preface, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9413:56"/> what gaue Chriſt cauſe to make this ſermon, where he
ſayth: <hi>Then reſorted vnto him all the Publicans and ſinners to heare
him.</hi> In which wordes he plainly ſignifieth with what me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt kept
companie,<note place="margin">With what kind of men Chriſt was
conuerſant.</note> namely with them, which in the ſight of all men liued as
it did not become them, and were openly called ſinners and euell perſons.
Whereby it appeareth that the Phariſees ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue ſufficient cauſe
to finde fault with Chriſt, for that he, which would be counted holy, did
familiarly keepe companie with ſuch men.<note place="margin">Publicans what
they were.</note> For they were commonly called Publicans at that time, to whom
the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did let out ſome citie or cuſtome, or ſome charge or
ouerſight in matters, for a certain ſumme of money: as the Turke or
Venetians do now commit to ſome one ſome citie or office, for which a
certain ſumme of money is year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be payed, and what ſoeuer they ſhall
ſcrape togither by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt exactions aboue this ſumme, that is their
owne. So alſo the aforeſaid Publicans did, which ſo gathered thoſe
tributes and money wherewith they were charged, that they themſelues alſo
might haue ſome gaine thereby. And ſeing that a ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be
paide for ſome citie or office was not ſmall, they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to gaine
thereby, did by all meanes deale vniuſtly, and vſed extortion in all
thinges, in all places, and with all perſons. For the Lordes and maiſters
held them ſo hardly and ſtraightly, that they could not get much thereby,
if they would deale rightly and iuſtly, and oppreſſe no man with vniuſt
exactions. Whereupon they had a verie euell report abroad, that they were
moſt vniuſt exactors, and endued with ſmall honeſtie and integritie of
life. Likewiſe the reſt in generall were called ſinners, which
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe liued diſhoneſtly and wretchedly, &amp; were defiled with
filthie offences, as with couetouſnes, with whoredome, with ſurfetting and
drunkennes, and ſuch like. Such reſort here vnto Chriſt, and come to
heare him, when as before they had knowen him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be excellent and
famous both in wordes and deedes.</p>
            <p>Howbeit it is certaine that in them although they ſemed euen
deſperate, there was a ſparke of vertue and honeſtie, in aſmuch as they
longed after Chriſt, both couering to heare his doctrine, and alſo
earneſtly deſiring to ſee the workes which he did, when before they knewe
him to be a good man, and heard no ill report either of his doctrine or workes,
ſo that their life did farre differ from his. Neuertheles they are ſo wel
diſpoſed, that they are not <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9413:56"/> his enemies, neither
refuſe or flie his company, but runne vnto him, not of any euell purpoſe or
intent, but to ſee and heare ſome good thing, whereby they may amend their
life.<note place="margin">The maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes &amp;
Phariſees.</note> Contrariwiſe the Phariſes and Scribes, which were
counted moſt righteous and holy, are ſuch poyſonfull beaſtes, that they
are not only ſore diſpleaſed at Chriſt, whom they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abide neither to
ſee nor heare, but alſo they can not be content, that miſerable ſinners
ſhould come vnto him, and heare him, whereby they being led by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
might amend: Yea they do alſo beſide this, murmur, and reproue Chriſt,
for that he admitted vnto him, and receiued Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and ſinners, ſaying:
Behold, is this that holy and famous man? Who will now ſay that he is of God,
when as he hath ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with ſo wicked wretches? yea rather he is a
drinker of wine and a glutton, as they ſay elſewhere,<note place="margin">Luke 7.34.</note> a freind to Publicans and ſinners.</p>
            <p>Such a report he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to beare of the holy Phariſes,
not for that he giuing himſelfe to gluttonie and ſurfetting, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to feede exceſſiuely and followe riotous pleaſure togither with them, but
onely becauſe he admitted ſuch into his company, and did not
contemptuouſly reiect them. For in their opinion he ſhould haue gone with a
ſad and auſtere countenance, in baſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, &amp; haue remained
ſeuered from the conuerſation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of men, and refuſed their
felowſhippe, leſt that by familiar cuſtome with them, he ſhould be
defiled, and ſhould haue done as they were accuſtomed to do after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner
of holy men. Of whom Eſaie writeth, that they ſtudied for ſuch puritie,
that they did feare and ſuffer againſt their will euen the touching of a
ſinner. Which in deede plainly appeareth Luke 7. in the Phariſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
againſt Chriſt, becauſe he ſuffred himſelfe to be touched of the
ſinfull woman. And it was they, that would alway be his maiſters, &amp;
preſcribe vnto him rules whereby to liue, and behaue himſelfe in this life.
Therefore in this place they murmur, for that he did not applie himſelfe vnto
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither did diſdaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany &amp; conuerſation of ſuch
ſinners according to their example.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt alſo is ſomewhat ſtout, plainly ſhewing
here,<note place="margin">The ſtoutne of Chriſt.</note> that he can ſuffer
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſterſhip of none, but that he is altogither free &amp; exempt from
the commaundements of all, as commonly in the Goſpels we ſee him to be at
his owne will &amp; pleaſure, who neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles otherwiſe was both ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tler
and alſo more ſeruiceable then <pb n="96" facs="tcp:9413:57"/> all the reſt. But
when as they would deale with him by lawes, &amp; be his maiſters, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all
friendſhip ceaſſed, for he did not otherwiſe leape back, then the
adamant layd vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anuyle &amp; ſtriken, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and doing onely the
contrary of that which they require of him, although they ſeeme to ſpeake
euen rightly and well, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thereunto alſo the worde of God. As they
doe here, where they come and ſay: thou muſt doe thus, thou muſt follow
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of honeſt men, thou muſt flee the companye of wicked
men. This truly is a ſubſtantial doctrine, and confirmed by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of
the Scripture. For Moſes him ſelfe commaundeth the Iewes, to auoid euill
men, &amp; take away euil from amonge them. By this text they confirme their
ſayings, &amp; come with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note place="margin">Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the Vnicorne.</note> and would make Chriſt ſubiect to their lawes, and
haue him ruled by them.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt neuertheles will be at his owne libertie. And he is
not vnlike the Vnicorne, which beaſt men deny that he can be taken aliue,
with what kind of hunting ſoeuer he be aſſayled. He ſuffereth him
ſelfe to be wounded, to be ſtriken with darts, and to be ſlayne,<note place="margin">Chriſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of lawes.</note> to be taken he doth not
ſuffer him ſelfe. No otherwiſe doth Chriſt alſo, who although he be
ſet vpon by lawes, yet doth he not ſuffer them, but breaketh through as
through a ſpiders web, rebuking them moſt ſharpely. As Matth. 12. where
they found fault with his Diſciples, becauſe they had plucked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares of
corne on the Sabbath day, alleaging the commaundement of God that the Sabbath
was to be kept holy, &amp;c. he auoucheth the cleane contrary, tearing in
ſunder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commaundement, affirming the contrary both in wordes, and alſo
by examples. Alſo Matth. 16, where he declareth to his Apoſtles that he
ſhall ſuffer and be crucified, but Peter admoniſheth him to be of a good
there, and ſetteth before him the precept of charitie, ſaying:
<hi>Maiſter, pitie thy ſelfe,</hi> there againe he doth earneſtly and
ſharpely blame and rebuke his admoniſher, and ſayth: <hi>Get thee behinde
me, Satan: thou vnderſtandeſt not the thinges that are of God, but the
thinges that are of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in a ſumme, he is moſt impatient of all lawes wherewith
they deale with him, he will be moſt free from all commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and
acknowledged to be the Lord of them. He alway gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſuch aunſwers, as
with which he repreſſeth the exactors, neither wil he keepe any law as
though he were compelled to do <pb n="97" facs="tcp:9413:57"/> it. Contrariwiſe, when he
doth any thinge of his owne accorde, then no law is ſo litle or ſo light,
whereunto he doth not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey, and doth much more then it requireth.
Wherefore there can none be founde more gentle and ſeruiceable then he, if he

no reſt at all, but patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtained ſo much labour, that they
feared leſt he ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed in minde, or finally bringe ſome
hurt to his body. He doth all thinges that he can, but that he refuſeth to be
compelled, and ſuffereth no lawes to be preſcribed vnto him, which if any
ſet before him, he moſt ſtoutely reſiſteth and ſtriueth againſt
them. So he is both of a moſt ſtoute and of a moſt milde ſpirit,<note place="margin">Chriſt both of a moſt ſtout and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of a moſt mild

and neuertheles doth all thinges euen moſt aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it were

commaunding him, or by way of controlement exacting and requiring any thinge of
him, but he beinge permitted to doe voluntarily and of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges are done for our example, that we may learne what
a true Chriſtian man is after the ſpirit, leſt we iudge him according to
the lawe, and according to our owne wiſedom and vnderſtanding. For Chriſt
is therefore our Lorde, that he may make ſuch men of vs, as he is him
ſelfe. And as he can not ſuffer him ſelfe to be tied and bound with
lawes, but will be Lorde of lawes, yea and of all thinges, ſo alſo ought
not the conſcience of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuffer them. For we are ſo much
made free by Chriſt,<note place="margin">The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Chriſtian
muſt not be bound with lawes.</note> that our conſcience may know nothing
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning any law, whoſe iudgement &amp; controlement it may abide to
ſuffer. Neither ought we any otherwiſe to be affected according to the
ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward conſcience, then if no lawe had bene giuen or made: yea
as if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther x. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, nor one, either of God, or of Biſhop, or of
Ceſar were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs, that we may plainly ſay: I know nothing 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9413:58"/> of any law, neyther wil I know any thing. For in that
ſtate and condition, wherein we Chriſtians are, our workes, &amp; the
workes of all men doe ceaſe, yea and all lawes alſo. For where there is no
worke, neither can there be any law, requiring a worke and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: this
thing was to be done of thee, this to be left vndone. But we through Chriſt
are wholly free from all workes, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by meere grace and mercy,
whereby we liue onely before God. And this is our treaſure, whereby we are
Chriſtians, and liue and ſtand before God. For how we ought to liue in
outward conuerſation, to wit in fleſhe and blood before the world, it doth
nothing pertaine vnto this place.</p>

muſt learne ſo to rule his conſcience, that he ſuffer it not to be held

can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile any thinge with him, although otherwiſe he be moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
moſt ſweete and gentle of all men. Howbeit this art is aboue meaſure high
and excellent, which none but he vnderſtandeth, whereof he is the Maiſter,
who knoweth howe to appeaſe all lawes and teachers of lawes.<note place="margin">We of our ſelues are not able to pacifie and appeaſe the

vs, and as often as he ſetteth vpon the conſcience of man, he driueth him
to that point, that he entreth diſputation with him, what he hath done or not
done. Then ſuch a diſputation beginneth, as wherein is debated of our
ſinne and righteouſnes, euen then man is brought into a daungerous caſe
and into the myre, where be ſticketh, neither can he eſcape or rid him
ſelf out, but is forthwith deeper and deeper plunged in. For he is laden with
a heauy burden, which he is not able to beare, wherefore he walketh muſing,
gnawing &amp; conſuming his minde, neither can he get any quietnes thereof.
Which I doe plainely feele in my ſelfe, neither can I wraſtle out, and
deliuer my ſelfe by any trauell, although I labour alwayes, aſſaying all
meanes to eſcape out of this goulfe, that I may aunſwere the lawe, and
obtaine ſo much, that it may keepe ſilence, and ſay, now at length thou
haſt done ſo much, wherewith I am conſtrayned to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But all
endeuour and ſtudy is in vayne: for ſuch a deepe pit and daungerous goulfe
it is, out of which no man is able to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:9413:58"/> although
he ioyne the helpes of all men to him ſelf, as they can beare me witnes which
haue made triall hereof, and doe as yet daily trie it.</p>
            <p>The cauſe is our nature, which will haue to doe with workes and
lawes, and heare what they ſay, and followe them that ſay: Why doth he eate
with Publicanes and ſinners? if he did eate and drinke with vs, he ſhould
do wel. Alſo: why do thy Diſciples plucke the eares of corne on the Sabbath
day? &amp;c. with whom it will haue to do ſo long, til the law ſayth: now
thou art righteous. For it can attaine to no higher vnderſtanding, then that
the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the law is the chiefeſt doctrine, and that the
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof is the beſt life before God. In it it continually
remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſo captiue yea and bound, neither can it by any meanes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it
ſelf out of this priſon, being not able to pacifie and appeaſe the law,
that it doe not exact any thinge of it, or reprehend it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but it
is compelled to be captiue therein as in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall priſon, and the longer
it ſtriueth and fighteth with the lawe, into ſo much worſe caſe doth it
alwayes come, vntill at the laſt it be wholy ſubdued.</p>
            <p>What therfore muſt I do,<note place="margin">What a Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian
muſt do when the law vrgeth his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> the law aſſailing
&amp; vrging my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, eſpecially when I perceiue my ſelfe not to
do that which it requireth? I aunſwere, euen that which Chriſt doth here,
who admitteth or acknowledgeth no law, although brought out of the law of God.
So learne thou alſo to doe, that thou mayeſt boldely ſay to the lawe,
leaue of lawe to diſpute with me, I haue nothing to doe with thee. And for
that very ſame cauſe, for which thou commeſt to diſpute with me, and to
enquire of me, how good and righteous I am, I will not heare thee. For it here
maketh no matter, what I am, or what I ought to doe, and what not to doe, but
what Chriſt him ſelfe is, ought to doe, and doeth. For nowe we are in the
bridechamber, where onely the bridegrome and the bride muſt haue to doe, and
it behoueth not thee to come thither, nor to intermeddle any thing there.</p>
            <p>But neuertheles it now and then knocketh and ſayth: in the meane
ſeaſon notwithſtanding good workes muſt be done of thee, the
commaundements of God muſt be kept,<note place="margin">How we muſt
au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere the law whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is inſtant vpon vs.</note> if thou wilt obtaine
ſaluation. Aunſwere againe: but thou heareſt that it is not nowe tyme to
ſpeake of them: for now I haue obtayned my righteouſnes and the ſumme of
all my ſaluation without my <pb n="100" facs="tcp:9413:59"/> workes in Chriſt my
Lorde, and am already ſaued before thou cameſt, therefore I haue no neede
of thy preſence. For as I haue ſayd, where workes preuayle nothing, neyther
is the law there of any importance or weight, and where there is no law,
neither is there any ſinne. The bride therefore alone, all the reſt beinge
excluded, muſt reigne in the bridechamber with Chriſt, in whom ſhee hath
all thinges at once, neyther needeth ſhee any thinge more, which is
neceſſary to ſaluation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lawe muſt be excluded and
vtterly reiected, yea and caſt of, as often as it will inuade and ſet vpon
the conſcience. For ſurely it ought not to medle therewith, neither commeth
it in tyme, when it will haue muche to doe there, where it ought to haue
nothing to doe, and whither it ought in no wiſe to come. For the conſcience
reſteth in this article of our Chriſtian faith, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Ieſus
Chriſt my Lord, which ſuffered, died, &amp; was buried for me, &amp;c. vnto
whom both Moſes law, &amp; Ceſars, &amp; diuine lawes ought to giue place.
All that therfore is boldly to be chaſed from me, whatſoeuer will diſpute
with me of ſinnes, righteouſnes, and ſuch like thinges.</p>
            <p>Beholde, Chriſt would in this place reſemble this libertie
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that as Chriſtians we ſuffer no maiſter in our conſcience,
truſting moſt conſtantly to this one thinge, that we are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and
called vnto Chriſt, and by him iuſtified and ſanctified, whereupon we may
ſay: He is my righteouſnes, my treaſure, my worke, and in a ſumme, what
not? againſt ſinne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes (whereof the lawe indeuoureth to
accuſe me) If it pleaſe you to haue other righteouſnes, workes, lawe,
&amp;c. then may ye take them from whence ye will, ſurely ye ſhall finde no
place for them in me. Thus may a man defend him ſelf, and ſtande againſt
the ſuggeſtions and tentations of the Deuill, and of ſinnes either paſt
or preſent. Wherefore Moſes and Chriſt are farre to be ſeparated
aſunder, as alſo workes and faith, the conſcience and the outward life,
ſo that if the lawe will ſette vpon me, and make my hart afrayde, then is
it tyme to ſende it away, and if it will not giue place, to thruſt it out
by force, and to ſay: I will willingly doe good workes, and will goe forward
as much as I am able for that time that I liue amonge men, but here I wil know
nothing at al of them in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, &amp; therefore let me alone, &amp;
prate nothing of them. For here I will <pb n="101" facs="tcp:9413:59"/> vouchſafe to
heare neither Moſes nor the Phariſees, but Chriſt alone doth obtaine
place to reigne here. I will like vnto Marie, ſit at his feete to heare his
worde, but let Martha cary abroade, and buſie her ſelfe in the kitchin and
about the houſhold affayres. And in a ſumme, I will not trouble the
quietnes of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay,<note place="margin">An obiection</note>
whereas in the meane ſeaſon I doe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne, which ſurely is euill?
I aunſwere, in deede it is true,<note place="margin">The aunſwer</note> I am
a ſinner, and I do vniuſtly, but I muſt not therefore deſpeire, as
though I were ſubiect to condemnation, yea or tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the
rigour of the lawe. For by faith I apprehend him, which hath apprehended me,
and apply my ſelfe vnto him, which hath embraced me in baptiſme, and hath
put me in his boſom, and by the preaching of the Goſpell hath called me to
the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all his good thinges, bidding me to beleeue in him. Nowe when
as I haue apprehended him by faith, then may I be bold to bid the Phariſees,
and Moſes with his tables, all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers with their bookes, all men with their
workes holde their peace and giue place. No law hath then any power to conuince
or accuſe me: for in this Chriſt I haue all thinges aboundantly,
whatſoeuer can be required in me.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, is the doctrine and arte of Chriſtians, the
ſcope and ende whereof is this, euen to reigne with Chriſt. But bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
men doe not vnderſtand it, taking hereupon occaſion to liue more freely, as
they liſt, ſaying: what neede is there that I ſhould do good works,
foraſmuch as Chriſt hath abrogated the law, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Albeit we be free from the law, we muſt neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles doe good
workes after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt.</note> There fooliſh babbling is in no
wiſe to be borne, for Chriſt is on the other part alſo to be conſidered
of thee, and thou muſt marke what he doth more. For here he him ſelfe
ſayth: that he is that man which ſeeketh the miſerable and loſt
ſheepe, which alſo he witneſſeth by his preſent deede, by receiuing
ſinners and Pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licanes, and by preaching vnto them. Whereby thou ſeeſt
that he doth fulfill much more then the law commaundeth to be done, and
teacheth thee to doe the ſame by his example. He is of ſuch an heroicall
ſtomacke, that he will not be vnder the lawe, yet doth he of his owne accorde
moe thinges then the law requireth. Doe thou ſo alſo, neither looke when
thou ſhalt be forced and driuen on by the lawe, but without the lawe and of
thine owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde doe that which is needefull to be done, as Peter 1. Pet. 2 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9413:60"/> admoniſheth ſaying: <hi>as free, and not as hauing
the libertie for a cloke of malitiouſnes, but as the ſeruaunts of God.</hi>
And Paule Rom. 6: <hi>Being made free from ſinne, ye are made the ſeruaunts
of righteouſnes.</hi> Theſe are they, which do all thinges with a free
conſcience without the lawe, and vnconſtrained.</p>
            <p>For where the Goſpell is truely in the hart, it maketh a man to
be ſuch a one, as doth not looke while the law commeth, but is ſo full of
ioy in Chriſt, that he is with ſpeede caried vnto good works, doing well to
all men, as much as he is able, &amp; that of his owne accorde, before the law
commeth into his minde. Moreouer he beſtoweth both body and life, hauing no
regard, what he muſt therefore ſuffer, and ſo he is full of good workes
which volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily flowing as it were out of a continuall fountaine are deriued
vnto many: As Chriſt being compelled, doth not abide to take vp ſo much as
a ſtrawe, but vncompelled giueth him ſelfe to be crucified for me, and for
the whole worlde, dying for the loſt ſheepe.</p>
            <p>Howebeit it is very neceſſary to diſcerne theſe thinges
well, when it is come to hand ſtrokes and within the throwing of the dart, as
it is ſaid, the law and ſinnes diſputing now with thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then
ſee that thou doe boldly repreſſe Moſes, and bid him keepe
ſilence,<note place="margin">The old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into Moſes
ſchole.</note> ſending him abroade to the olde man. Driue him into Moſes
ſchole, that he may diſpute with him and ſay: Dooſt thou heare? thou
art too ſlowe and ſluggiſh in giuing and ſeruing thy neighbour. When
Chriſt is to be ſerued of thee, thou wilt more willingly ſerue thy belly:
thou wilt come in no perill for Chriſtes ſake, thou dooſt deceitfully
robbe thy neighbour circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting him by what meanes ſoeuer thou canſt.
For that ſluggiſh aſſe flying labour, and following onely idlenes and
wantonnes, vſe the tables of ſtone, whom euen againſt his will,
conſtrayne to goe on in his duety.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when thou ſhalt ſet vpon me, in that thinge which is
right and meete (thou muſt ſay vnto Moſes) I will willingly heare
thee,<note place="margin">We muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Moſes to deale with the outward man,
but not with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> and follow thy admonitions, namely
according to the outward man, and in outward life, where thou maiſt beare
rule like a ſcholemaiſter, &amp; as one gouerning a familie: Where thou
haſt power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund me, to be obedient, modeſt, patient, good to my
neighbour, dutifull and liberal toward the poore, &amp; to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate God with
praiſes poured forth to his glorie: moreouer to <pb n="103" facs="tcp:9413:60"/> be
content for his words ſake to abide the contumelies &amp; ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of
all perſons, &amp; to ſuffer euery kind of iniurie of the world. With all
which I am not greatly moued, yea I would doe more thinges then I am able to do
according to the outward man. For the ſpirit, by the teſtimonye of
Chriſt, is willing, and ready, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fleſh be weake.</p>
            <p>But if thou wilt go ſo farre, whither it is vnlawfull for thee
to come, that is, into my hart and conſcience, there will I neither ſee
thee, nor vouchſafe to heare thee. For there I haue an other both great &amp;
vnſpeakeable treaſure, whoſe name is Chriſt. And in a ſumme,
whatſoeuer pertaineth to bridle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward man, thou canſt not lay on a
ſufficient burden thereof: but thou muſt burden the conſcience nothing at
all. For he that enioyeth Chriſt, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all lawes, as Paul ſaith:
<hi>the lawe is not giuen for the iuſt,</hi> who notwithſtanding in the
meane time doth more thinges, then he is able to fulfill in the fleſh. For
according to the lawe we are ſinners, and concerning our perſon we muſt
abide vnder it. But through Chriſt we are farre aboue the lawe.</p>
            <p>So Moſes without Chriſt muſt exerciſe his groſſe
workes, whereby he may compel men which are not yet Chriſtians, to be
honeſt ciuely before the world: for he doth not make Chriſtians righteous
&amp; honeſt. Howbeit I will not deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth this, that he ſheweth
vnto them their duties, which otherwiſe they would willingly fulfil &amp;
ſatisfie, yea &amp; doe moe things alſo, but that the fleſh doth not ſo
willingly &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that readines wherwith it ought, follow the ſpirit. In
which reſpect they are to be admoniſhed and vrged, the conſcience
neuertheles remaining free, ſo that the law haue no power to accuſe them.
Wherfore ſuch doctrine &amp; admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition ought to be among Chriſtians (as
it is certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> among the Apoſtles there was) whereby euery man may be
admoniſhed of his ſtate &amp; office. As for the reſt which are not
Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Who they be which muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Moſes.</note> they muſt be ruled by Moſes lawes, &amp;
burdened with them both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly &amp; inwardly, wherby they may be forced
and afflicted, that they may do that which is right, forſaking that which is
euill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do it not with a patient and willing mind. Of which kind
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raſh multitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnruly commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obſtinat people
is, who do not regard or vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberty of Chriſt, although they
can babble &amp; glory of many things concerning the Goſpell, &amp; they
notwithſtanding do abuſe it only to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> luſt of their mind: let 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9413:61"/> them know that they are vnder the diſcipline and
correction of Moſes.</p>
            <p>For they are not ſuch men, as are capable of this doctrine,
which liue with ſuch a ſecure mind, that they thinke, they haue no neede of
the Goſpel, or that they otherwiſe do ſufficiently knowe it. But they
onely are capable hereof, which are buſied with the diſputation of the
conſcience &amp; the law, of ſinnes &amp; of the wrath of God, by
conſideration whereof they become aſtonied, feeling the words of the hart
ſpeaking thus: Alas, how wretchedly haue I led my life? what account ſhal I
make vnto God? &amp; ſo they be too much fearful &amp; amaſed, the reſt
being more then is meete ſecure and preſumptuous, feeling no lawe nor
ſinne, no nor any trouble at all. And the caſe ſtandeth very vnequally
with both, for they which ſhould haue nothing to do with the law, do moſt
of all wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, &amp; alone feele it. But others of whom onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
law ſhould be felt, are nothing moued with it: yea the more grieuouſly they
are terrified by the lawe &amp; the wrath of God, by ſo much they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more indurate. There muſt therfore be an other maiſter to amend theſe,
namely, the ſlayer &amp; tormentor, who may teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being vnwilling to do
wel in the name of the Lord &amp; with fauour, in the name of an other to do
that that becommeth them, with no fauour, the reward alſo of hell fire and of
all miſeries being ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>Howbeit Chriſt both here and euery where elſe (as it is
ſaid) both by doctrine &amp; alſo by his owne example teacheth vs, which
feele our ſinnes and the burden of the lawe, and would willingly be
Chriſtians, to accuſtome our ſelues to fight againſt it, &amp; driue it
from vs vnto others, to giue no place to the Deuil, who would by the lawe
breake vppe the bridechamber of Chriſt, and thruſt him ſelfe into his
place, that is, take away from the conſcience her ioy and comfort, whereby he
may drawe man into deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he may not be able cheerefully to lift
vppe his hart and heade before God. For this is the arte of Chriſtians whom
it behoueth to knowe and learne moe thinges,<note place="margin">Chriſtians
muſt knowe how to fight againſt the deuill and to beare his
aſſaults.</note> then that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and blockiſhe common ſorte knoweth
and vnderſtandeth, that we may knowe well the maner how to fight with the
deuill, and to beare his aſſault, as often as he ſhall ſet vpon vs,
&amp; diſpute with vs out of Moſes. With whome when he goeth about ſuch
things, we muſt not diſpute in many wordes, but muſt forthwith 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9413:61"/> appeale from Moſes to Chriſt, and cleaue to him. For
all his trauaills &amp; deceits tend vnto this end, that he may craftely plucke
vs from Chriſt, and draw vs vnto Moſes. For he knoweth full well, the
matter being brought to that point, the victorie ſhalbe on his ſide.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thou muſt againe and againe take heede that thou
ſuffer not thy ſelfe to be plucked out of this hauen,<note place="margin">We
muſt take moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heede that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell plucke vs not from Chriſt
to Moſes.</note> neither to be entiſed out of this circle. And although he
ſhall lay many things againſt thee out of the lawe, euen inaſmuch as it
is the word of God, whereunto it is meete that thou do obey, yet maiſt thou
aunſwere him and ſay: doeſt thou not heare, that I will now know or heare
nothing concerning the lawe? for we are now in that circle and hauen, wherein
it is not enquired what I muſt do; or leaue vndone, but by what means we
obtaine to haue God gentle and fauourable vnto vs, and how we get remiſſion
of ſinnes. Here I will abide in the armes of Chriſt, cleauing
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably about his necke, and creeping into his boſome, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the lawe ſhall ſay, and my heart ſhall feele: neuertheles, ſo that we
keepe the principall part of our faith ſyncere, and the chiefe point ſafe,
outwardly I will willingly do and ſuffer, what burden ſoeuer it ſhall lay
vpon me. Beholde, he that vnderſtood this art well, ſhould be a right and
perfect man, as Chriſt was, ſo farre aboue all lawes, that he might be bold
to call Peter Satan, and the Phariſees fooles, and leaders of the blynde, and
put Moſes himſelfe to ſilence, and ſo liue altogether without the lawe,
and yet in the meane ſeaſon fulfill all lawes: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more be obſtinate
and ſtout againſt all that will enforce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him, and yet
notwithſtanding of his owne accord profite and obey all. But truly herein
conſiſteth all the defect, that we do neuer fully and perfectly learne this
arte, the deuell ſo letting and hindering vs, that we go prepoſterouſly
to worke, being too ready and willing to heare all things whatſoeuer the lawe
ſayth. At whoſe threatnings alſo we are not a litle aſtonied, which it
had bin better for vs not to haue heard. Againe in outward things alſo we
giue our ſelues to libertie more then is conuenient, whereas the body
ſhould be kept vnder &amp; bridled with workes, whereby it might be compelled
to beare what ſoeuer ſhould be grieuous vnto it, when as yet it oftentimes
ſinneth, yet ſo, that ſinne abide without, where it muſt abide, &amp;
haue his Moſes, who <pb n="106" facs="tcp:9413:62"/> alwaies may be nere vnto it with
his exactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Howbeit inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let no ſinne or law beare rule, or reigne,
but let Chriſt alone rule and reigne by mere grace, ioy and comfort. So all
thinges ſhould be done rightly, and man ſhould be apt and fit to all good
thinges, both to do, and alſo to ſuffer, with a glad and obedient heart by
faith not feyned in the grace of God through Chriſt. Wherefore let the
conſcience beare rule ouer all lawes, let the fleſh be ſubiect to euerie
law.</p>
            <p>Now he that is ſkilfull of this arte, let him giue thankes to
God, and take heede that he be not too wiſe in it, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not
a falſe perſuaſion of knowledge. For I and my like do not yet
vnderſtand it, as we ought to vnderſtand it, although we be moſt expert
of all, and haue bin longeſt exerciſed therein. For (as I haue ſaid) it
is ſuch an art, as no man knoweth, but they which are Chriſtians, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
learning wherof notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they are compelled to be ſcholers all there
life longe. Wherefore moſt farre of from the knowing hereof are thoſe
ſecure ſpirits, who alone know all things, but who in very deed beſide
that falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of knowledge, know nothing at all, and by this
verie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion they are fartheſt of all drawne from this art and from
the whole Goſpell. Neither is there any thing more grieuous, no nor a greater
hurt can be brought vnto Chriſtianitie, then by theſe pettie doctours and
maiſters, which ſeeme vnto themſelues to haue ſome wiſedome. For they
fill all corners of the world with ſects and factions, being ſuch men, as
ſerue neither God nor men, heare neither the lawe nor the Goſpell, but
contemne the lawe with a ſecure mynde, and loath the Goſpell with hearing
it, alwayes ſeeking after new doctrine. But truly we teach nothing for their
ſakes, inaſmuch as they are not worthie of our doctrine, and are ſo
puniſhed of God, that they can neuer learne it, &amp; bring forth any frute
thereby, although they heare it. Therefore let vs only keepe it, whereof they
do take away nothing at all from vs, but that they heare a vaine noyſe and
ſounde of it.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt part of this ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which
Chriſt teacheth by his owne example, how euery man ought to keepe his
conſcience free from all diſputation of the lawe, and terrour of the wrath
of God and of ſinnes. Nowe conſequently I thinke it good diligently to
conſider this excellent and goodly parable of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 15.3.</note> where he beginneth and ſayth: <hi>What man of
you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <pb n="107" facs="tcp:9413:62"/> an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth sheepe, if he loſe one of them,
doeth not leaue ninetie and nine in the wildernes, and go after that which is
loſt vntill he find it?</hi> Chriſt is not onely of a ſtout mynde, who
will not follow the wordes and maiſterſhip of them, but he bringeth
probable cauſes alſo of his ſtoutnes, with great cunning refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their
obiections, and ſtopping their mouthes, ſo, that they can murmure nothing
againſt him. Moreouer he conuinceth them by their owne example and deede, and
concludeth, that they ought for good cauſe to be vtterly aſhamed, being
bold to ſpeake vnto him, &amp; reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that in him in ſo great a matter,
which they themſelues do in a much leſſe. For by what meanes could he
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more readily aunſwere them, then if he ſhould ſay:<note place="margin">How
Chriſt aunſwered the Scribes and Phariſees when they murmured for that he
receiued ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners vnto him.</note> Will you, O excellent and moſt wiſe
maiſters, commaund this thing, and teache me to driue away and alienate from
me miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which long after me, and come to heare me, when as
there is nothing that you your ſelues do not for one loſt ſhepes ſake,
who leauing ninetie and nine in the wildernes (that is in the field and at the
fold) do runne to ſeeke that which is loſt, neither do ye leaue of
ſeeking, vntill ſuch time, as ye haue found it, and brought it home? And
you count it to be well and commendably done, for which if any ſhould finde
fault with you, without dout ye would reproue him as mad and beſide
himſelfe. And ſhould not I as a Sauiour of ſoules do likewiſe with men,
as you do with a loſt ſhepe? ſeing there is no compariſon euen of one
ſoule to all the creatures liuing &amp; breathing in the earth. Why
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are you not vtterly aſhamed of your doings, preſuming to
reprehend me in this worke, which you your ſelues commend, and are forced to
commend? Wherefore if ye reproue and finde fault with me, you your ſelues are
firſt to be reproued and found fault with. This is rightly to haue
aunſwered, and with honour to haue ſtopped the mouthes of theſe
controllers &amp; fault finders, the cauſes being ſufficiently ſhewed,
why they ought not here to finde fault with him or controlle him. They haue
well ſurely yeelded vnto him with ſhame enough, as it is meete, and haue
gained nothing els by their maiſterſhip and controllement then vtter
ſhame and ignominie. For it is a ſhame to ſuch maiſters, yea and an
exceeding great abomination, that they ſticke not to arrogate ſo much vnto
themſelues, as to teache that man, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him of his dutie, who of
God is appointed a maiſter ouer <pb n="108" facs="tcp:9413:63"/> all. But it ought ſo
to fall out, as I haue ſaid, that he which will rule and iudge a Chriſtian
by his maiſterſhip, and endeuoureth to bring him from his baptiſme and
the article of Chriſt, to be ruled by his wiſedome or law, doth not onely
become a foole, but is alſo the author of extreme abomination and homicide.
For he worketh ſhame to the temple and ſanctuarie of God, and with
deueliſh raſhnes inuadeth his kingdom, where he alone with the holy Ghoſt
muſt reigne. Wherefore he verie well deſerueth, that God againe bring him
to ſhame and ignominie before the whole world, ſeing that he taketh to
himſelfe maiſterſhip in that place, where only Chriſt ought to be
maiſter, and not vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his great euell he kicketh againſt the
pricke.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is not good to ieſt with Chriſtians, for they are
Sainces, and let him that is wiſe, not be too buſie with that man, whoſe
name is Chriſt, for he can get no gaine thereby, for Chriſt is moſt
impatient of all their maiſterſhip and doctrine. So alſo a Chriſtian
muſt by no meanes ſuffer them, or if he ſuffer them, giuing place to
ſuch ſuggeſtions, to wit, thou oughteſt to haue done this or that, or
as yet thou oughteſt to do it, then is his caſe become exceeding ill,<note place="margin">We muſt in any wiſe cleaue faſt vnto Chriſt.</note>
inaſmuch as he hath fallen from Chriſt. Therefore we muſt endeuour, to
hold Chriſt faſt, hauing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, although all the world ſhall teach
vs. For if we ſhall abide with him, and hold the true vnderſtanding of the
article concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, we ſhall eaſily ouercome all ſuch maiſters and
tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. For this Chriſt wilbe moſt free from all controlement &amp;
maiſterſhip, contending to be the onely maiſter and controller of all
men, that either in fauour they may reuerently acknowledge him for the Lord and
maiſter, and themſelues for fooles, or in furie and indignation being
ſubiect to the reproch of all men, may vtterly periſh.</p>
            <p>But I haue ſaid before, that the preſent doctrine for the
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie exceeding goodnes, ſweetnes and conſolation thereof, is not to be
ſet forth to the rude, blockiſh, and vnrulely common ſort, to whom we do
not preach it, but to thoſe onely, which ſtriue with terrour and anguiſh
of conſcience, or ſtand in perill and daunger of death, and diſpute with
the deuell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whereby he would driue them
vnto deſperation. Before theſe this amiable image is to be ſet, whereby
they may receiue comfort and cheerefulnes of minde. As for others which liue 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9413:63"/> with a ſecure mind, and do litle know what anguiſh
and ſpiritual ſorowfulnes is, they are to be ledde to Moſes to the
tormentour. For it is an image moſt pleaſaunt and amiable, and more
arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially painted, then any Apelles is able to paint with his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill.
Neither doth any man excell in ſuch eloquence of ſpeeche, that he is able
ſufficiently to declare &amp; comprehend it in wordes. Wherefore it is to be
apprehended in the hearte by fayth, as much as may be. Neuertheles we muſt
ſpeake ſomething of it, that we may giue cauſe and occaſion to other to
thinke and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more earneſtly thereof.</p>
            <p>I alſo, ſayth he, haue an hundred ſheepe, that is, that
litle flock of all Chriſtiandom, of which number one is loſt, and fallen
from the communion of Chriſtians. Now therefore doeſt thou deſire to know
the affection of my minde? then muſt thou beſtow thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to paint
out well and cunningly both the ſhepeheard and the loſt ſheepe. For that
ſhepeheard, which is but a man, and guideth the flocke, which is created to
be ſlaine, hath great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to preſerue it in ſafetie, and is not a
litle carefull, how he may finde the ſheepe when it is loſt, and bring it
home againe,<note place="margin">How the ſheep is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towarde his
ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</note> and with no leſſe deſire the ſheepe longeth after
the ſhepehearde. Whom if it vnderſtand to be his owne ſhepeheard (as by
nature it doth vnderſtand) it feareth him not, but runneth vnto him with
great confidence, and being full of good hope, goeth before him, Yea as ſoone
as euer it heareth his voice, it aunſwereth by blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.<note place="margin">The affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his ſheepe.</note> On
the otherſide alſo the ſhepeheard hath greate care and deſire to finde
againe the loſt ſhepe, which hath ſtrayed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Both he himſelfe
ſeeketh, &amp; ſendeth forth ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to ſeeke there, whitherſoeuer
he thinketh it is ſtrayed, neither doth he leaue ſeeking, vntill hauing
found it, he hath brought it home. For he is not ignoraunt how miſerable a
liuing creature a ſolitary ſheep is, whoſe life conſiſteth onely in
the helpe and ſafe keeping of the ſhepeheard, inaſmuch as it can nothinge
at all helpe it ſelfe, but being deſtitute of a ſhepeheard, is
conſtrayned to periſh. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, it is alſo fearfull and ready to goe
ſtray, and as ſoone as it hath wandered out of the way, and from the
ſhepeheard, forthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with commeth into perill of life, &amp; can not tary,
although being brought, it commeth to an other flocke, and a ſtraunge
ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard calleth it, neuertheles it goeth on through thornie and ſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
places, through waters and fennes, vntill it come in daunger 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9413:64"/> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woulfe, or waſted by ſome other miſchiefe
vtterly periſheth. And although it be brought into by wayes and deſerts,
and is now thought to be loſt, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it hath this hope, as much
as nature hath put into it, that if it might heare his ſhepeheard, it
ſhould forthwith exceedingly reioyce being deliuered from all euell. Moreouer
neither doth the ſhepeheard therefore ſeeke it, that when he hath found it,
he may wrathfully fight with it, or handle it ill for that it hath gone
aſtray, or caſt it to the woulfe to be torne in pieces, but all his care
and thought is, that he may moſt gentlely allure it to himſelfe, and may
deale with it moſt louingly, to wit, lay it on his ſhoulders and carie it,
vntill he hath brought it vnto the reſt of the flocke.</p>
            <p>This is that picture, reſembled in this creature &amp; ſilly
beaſt, whereby Chriſt ſheweth vnto vs, what affection of mynde he
beareth, and what he doth toward vs, and alſo what we ought to promiſe our
ſelues concerning him. For ſeeing this is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true in nature, the
ſame is much more true in the kingdom of Chriſt, which is the kingdom of
grace, loue, and conſolation. Therefore ſee that thou alſo do ſet
before thy ſelfe the ſheepe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this ſhepeheard, then ſhalt
thou truly vnderſtand, how much greater and vehementer care he hath taken to
preſerue it, alſo with how great ſtudy and diligence, yea and from the
heart he is carefull for it, that he may finde it and bring it home againe. For
he will haue his maruelous and continuall kindenes, and the vnſpeakeable
flames of his moſt feruent loue to be ſhewed, or rather poured forth vpon
miſerable, fearefull and trembling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which vnfeynedly lament
their ſinnes, and deſire to be deliuered from them, and ſuch are his true
ſheepe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The parable of the ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard &amp; the
loſt ſheepe reſembleth Chriſt, &amp; the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is ſtrayed
out of the way.</note>For with a man that hath loſt this ſhepeheard, and
heareth him not, the caſe ſtandeth as with the loſt ſheepe, which being
eſtraunged from his ſhepeheard, ſtrayeth more and more from him. And
although it be called by the voices of others, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto them, thinking
that it ſhal fynde his owne ſhepeheard, yet failing of his purpoſe it
findeth him not, but alway runneth from corner to corner, ſtraying vp and
downe, and ſtil wandreth farther out of the way. Neither it is ſuccoured
with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or helpe, before it heare the voice of the true ſhepeheard
ſounding againe in his eares: euen as we learne the ſame to be true by
daily experience, and euerie man trieth it in his owne <pb n="111" facs="tcp:9413:64"/>
heart. For the Goſpell of Chriſt being taken away or not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, here
ſome falſe maiſter, or author of ſome ſect, in an other place ſome
fanaticall felowe thruſteth in himſelfe, one peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Supper of the
Lord, the other baptiſme, one teacheth this, the other that, of a ſingular
holines of life, both which allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to himſelfe the miſerable and
ſtraying ſheepe, and ſheweth himſelfe ſo, as though he were he true
ſhepeheard. But by the means of theſe the ſheepe is entangled onely with
greater er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, vntill it wandreth quite and altogither out of the way. To
theſe commeth the deuill alſo with his cogitations, which he craftely
putteth into the heart: Alas, if thou hadſt done this or that, or hadſt not
done, &amp;c. with all which he practizeth nothing els, but that he may make it
fall into greater errours, that it may not know where to abyde. And this truly
falleth out, Chriſt being remoued out of ſight, and the article of him
being extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Whatſoeuer moreouer ſhalbe taught, counſeled,
&amp; ſhewed, by what meanes ſoeuer, all thinges neuertheles become worſe
and draw nere vnto deſtruction, vnles the true ſhepeheard come with his
voice, and call backe and bring againe the ſtraying ſheepe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it appeareth that it is exceeding neceſſarie &amp;
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that we learne to know Chriſt well,<note place="margin">It is very
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to learne to know Chriſt a right.</note> that we do not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him as a cruell tyranne or as an angrie iudge (as the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
hitherto haue ſet him forth to the people, and the deuel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſheweth him to the hearts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no otherwiſe to be thought vpon and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered) who hath drawne his ſword already againſt vs: But as the
ſheepe doth naturally looke on the ſhepeheard, not as on him, of whom it
ſhall be terrified, chaſed, and ſlaine, but ſo ſoone as it beholdeth
him, is cheered and put in hope of helpe, &amp; is no more in feare or
ſolitarines, but forthwith ſpeedely goeth to him with all boldnes: So
alſo when we deſire to conceyue a truſt and hope of helpe, and to be
ſtrengthened and eaſed with comfort, then the voice of our ſhepeheard,
that is of Chriſt, muſt be knowne and learned well of vs, all voices of
other ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards not regarded, which draw vs only into errours, and
toſſe vs vp and downe, and that onely article muſt be heard and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in minde, which Chriſt ſo louingly and comfortably painteth
in our heart, as by any meanes it can be painted, that I may with all
confidence and boldnes ſay: The Lord Ieſus Chriſt <pb n="112" facs="tcp:9413:65"/>
is my onely ſhepeheard, and I (alas) the loſt ſhepe, which hath ſtrayed
in the deſert, but am troubled with no ſmall anguiſh of mynde for my
wretched life, deſyring with moſt feruent affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both to haue God
fauourable vnto me, &amp; alſo to haue peace in my conſcience. But truely I
vnderſtand here, that he is no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of me, then I am of him.
I labour with great carefullnes to come vnto him, and he is carefull and
deſyreth greatly that he may bring me againe vnto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>If we were certainly thus perſwaded of his affection towarde vs,
and did graue in our minde that it ſo greatly deſireth after vs, and is
ſo ſweetely poured forth vpon vs, it can not be, that we ſhould abhorre
and feare him, but we would with a cheerefull minde runne vnto him, and tary
only with him, abyding to heare the doctrine or voice of no other. For the
doctrine of an other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betweene, either of Moſes or of any one what
ſoeuer, doth nothing els but trouble and diſquiet the conſcience,<note place="margin">No peace or quietnes but in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> ſo that it
can neuer fynde any peace or quietnes. Therefore Chriſt ſayth Matth. 11.
<hi>Come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden, and I will eaſe you. Take
my yoke on you, and ye shall fynde reſt vnto your ſoules, &amp;c.</hi> As
though he ſaide: runne and ſeeke in what places ſoeuer ye will, heare and
learne what ſoeuer can be preached vnto you, yet ſhall ye fynde no quietnes
of heart, ye ſhall fynde no peace but in me alone. We wil eaſily permit
good workes to be preached, a righteous life to be taught, the ten
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements to be deliuered by inſtruction, and all things els which
ſerue to the amendement of life, but ſo farre onely, as they are taught to
the vnrulely and vntractable common ſort, alſo to force and bridle the
wantonnes of our old Adam. But they which preach to the conſcience wrapped in
anguiſhes and terrours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſynne, ought to preach no other word
then of Chriſt. For this is that loſt and miſerable ſhepe, of whom no
other mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is to be borne or had, but that onely ſhepeheard Chriſt,
who neither vrgeth it with the lawe, nor is eger vpon it, but moſt ſweetely
and gently handleth it, and layeth the miſerable and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſheepe vpon
his ſhoulders, doing that of his owne accord, which was to be done of the
ſheepe, as we ſhall heare by and by more at large.</p>
            <p>But ſurely in this place the doctrine of both (as is before
alſo ſayde at large) or the voice of Moſes and of Chriſt, muſt be 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9413:65"/> well diſcerned.<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
betwene the doctrine of Moſes and of Chriſt muſt be throughly knowne of
Chriſtians.</note> For Moſes ought to haue no entraunce to the loſt
ſheepe, no nor by any meanes is to be admitted to it, although he preach
beſt of all other. For if confounding theſe, we will comfort and erect the
troubled conſcience by the lawe after this ſort: be of a good cheere, for
thou haſt not committed homicide, neither haſt thou defiled thy ſelfe
with adulterie, neither haſt thou perpetrated any other haynous offence, or
done it with a good will, &amp;c. This alſo is a comfort, but which can
endure a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmall time, neither can it ſuſtaine the aſſaults and
violence of the enemie, neither bringeth it or containeth any thing els but
confidence of it ſelfe, wherewith the miſerable ſheepe is holpen nothing.
For it remayneth as much wandring and loſt as before, neither can it helpe it
ſelfe, or come to his owne ſhepeheard. But if we will helpe &amp; ſuccour
it, we muſt ſhew vnto it the true ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, who commeth to ſeeke it,
that hauing found it he may bring it home againe, and exhibit his voice vnto it
to be heard. Hereby it may obtaine true and effectuall conſolation, and be
bold to aunſwere Moſes, and ſay: Now truely I haue not any care either of
thy comfort or terrour, and if it pleaſe thee, ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſynnes as much
as poſſibly thou canſt, make me a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer and parricide, or the
worſt man of all men. For now I will neither heare thee with an aſtonied
minde, nor follow thee. But this is the ſumme of my comfort and ſaluation,
whereunto alſo I do confidently truſt, that I haue ſuch a ſhepeheard as
ſeeketh me of his owne accord, and hauing layd me on his ſhoulders ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
me. Let vs enter diſputation hereof if thou art ſo diſpoſed, not how
righteous or vnrighteous I am, but how I haue come vnto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we muſt alwayes preach according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and
qualitie of the hearers. For I haue ſayd that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not fit for a
blockiſh and vntractable man. As it is not meete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a laborious threſher
ſhould be fed with delicates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſicke are to be ſtrengthened
and refreſhed, but the hyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is to be fed with broune bread and cheſe,
&amp; with water. The other dainty meates and eaſy of digeſtion thou muſt
reſerue for the ſicke or children, which are able to digeſt no groſſe
meat:<note place="margin">Vnto whom Moſes lawe muſt be prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched.</note> So
in this thing alſo thou muſt obſerue the ſame differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that thou do
rightly diſtribute theſe things, and giue vnto euerie one his portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a
prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t houſeholder. For thou muſt keepe the doctrine <pb n="114" facs="tcp:9413:66"/>
of Moſes and of the Lawe, vntill thou light vpon vnruly, harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and
vntractable men, which lead their life ſecurely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, ſet
before theſe onely ſtrong and common meates of threſhers to be eaten,
that is, offer angrie Moſes vnto them to be heard, who lighteneth and
thundreth from the mount Sina, who terrifieth the people of Iſrael, bringeth
them into the deſert, and drowneth king Pharao in the red ſea.<note place="margin">How weake and afflicted conſciences muſt be prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched
vnto.</note> But when thou ſhalt light vpon troubled hearts, and weake and
afflicted conſciences, which are now become loſt ſheepe, then ſpeake
not a word concerning Moſes and all the workes of God done in the lawe, but
let thy talke be only of the workes done by Chriſt in the time of grace,
&amp; well and diligently repeate to the miſerable conſcience, how he
ſheweth himſelfe toward the loſt ſhepe, to wit, that he is the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle
&amp; good ſhepeheard, which is exceeding careful for the loſt ſhepe,
ſo that leauing all the reſt, he traueleth to fynde that one, and to bring
it againe into the way, neither doth he leaue of till he hath brought it home.
For it is a verie great griefe vnto him, that any man ſhould be in ſynne,
and therefore be troubled and feare, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he that any ſhould
remaine therein, and ſo periſh. Wherefore he doth moſt louingly allure
&amp; prouoke thee by his ſweete Goſpell to come vnto him, &amp; ſuffer
thy ſelfe to be layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſhoulders and caried, and to be called his

            <p>As for them that liue ſecurely and pleaſauntly, &amp; haue no
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whether God be angrie or pleaſed, they are not to be called loſt
ſheepe,<note place="margin">The loſt ſheepe.</note> but rather wilde goats,
which ſuffer not themſelues either to be fed or ruled. But he, to whom his
ſynnes are a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; who fighteth in the fight of faith, where he is
not in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to loſe Moſes, but Chriſt himſelfe, and the principall
article, that is, where the conſcience is in anguiſh, and feare, whether it
hath God gentle and fauourable, this is that verie man, who with groning and
ſighes ſeeketh out and crieth for his ſhepeheard, &amp; deſireth to be
holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Dauid doth Pſal. 119. <hi>I haue gone aſtray like a sheepe that
is loſt: oh ſeeke thy ſeruaunt, &amp;c.</hi> In the mouth of theſe this
ſuger &amp; theſe pleaſaunt delicates haue a good taſt, with which the
heart is refreſhed, that it fall not into deſperation, but being againe
recreated with ſuch a conſolation, is lifted vp, not by Moſes but by
Chriſt. Not that it hath Moſes a freind or is able to pacifie him, but
becauſe it hath God fauourable through Chriſt, whereſoeuer Moſes
remayneth with his comfort. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <pb n="115" facs="tcp:9413:66"/> it be very well, as
alſo it is meete, that we do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the lawe practize theuerie, that
we ſteale not, that we commit not homicide, or otherwiſe do iniurie and
hurt to our neighbour. Howbeit that is not the right comfort of the heart,<note place="margin">No true com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be had by the lawe.</note>
but onely a momentane tickling of the vtmoſt ſkinne, not during &amp;
pearſing. For the deuell comming &amp; ſetting vpon the heart, all comfort
is vtterly taken away. And although in ſome point thou haſt done well and
rightly, he neuertheles againe bringeth ten fold more, wherein thou haſt done
amiſſe, yea euen in the moſt pure workes he can finde much impuritie, and
turne all into ſinne.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we muſt in no wiſe truſt vnto ſuch comfort,<note place="margin">We muſt not truſt to the comfort of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, but muſt
reſort and cleaue faſt vnto Chriſt.</note> but muſt rather refuſe it
and ſay: whether I be good or euell at this preſent I do not diſpute, but
wil reſerue it rather vnto that place, where it ſhalbe taught and entreated
concerning workes. But in this circle wherein I now ſtand, there is no place
to entreat of workes and integrity of life, but of Chriſt and his workes,
which he dooth toward me a loſt ſheepe. Wherefore if thou demaund whether I
be good or honeſt, I aunſwere plainly, no, but if thou demaund whether
Chriſt be good and righteous, that vndouted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am able to confirme, and him
I ſet for my goodnes and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, vnto whom alſo alone I
couragiouſly appeale. For in his name I am baptized, of which thing I haue a
ſeale and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, to wit, that I am his ſhepe, &amp; that he is that
good ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſeeking his loſt ſhepe, &amp; dealing with me without
all lawe, exacting nothing of me, neither as Moſes vrgeth, troubleth, and
forceth me, but ſheweth vnto me his meere &amp; moſt ſweete grace, while
he ſubmitteth himſelfe to me, &amp; layeth me on his ſhoulders, and
carieth me. Why therefore ſhould I feare the thundrings of Moſes and of the
deuell, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I reſt in his ſafe cuſtody, which hath giuen vnto me his
righteouſnes and all other things, which holdeth and carieth me, ſo that
there is now no more daunger leſt I periſh, I remaining a ſheepe and
denying not my ſhepeheard, but repoſing my ſelfe wholy in him?</p>
            <p>Thus haſt thou Chriſt moſt louingly ſet forth, vnto thee.
Now onely faith is required, whereof there is great neede.<note place="margin">A
hard thing to feele true comfort of conſcience.</note> For this doctrine is
excellent, &amp; repleniſhed with moſt ſweete conſolation and comfort,
but this is wanting, that the vſe thereof is not felt, where it ought to be
felt. For when the ſhepe goeth aſtray, that is, when a man feeleth
himſelfe grieued with his ſynnes, and can <pb n="116" facs="tcp:9413:67"/> not tell
where to abyde, and is caſt of the deuell into a great feare of minde, then
he alwayes runneth vnto the contrary, neither can he comprehend or conceyue in
minde, that this is true, all things falling out of his minde, which he heard
here, becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feeling and feare. For the deuell hath
daſeled his eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he perceiue any thing els but the wrath and
indignation of God. Wherewith his heart is ſo burdened, that he is not able
to raiſe vp himſelfe in minde, and to turne his eyes any other where. Nay
he lyeth ſo drowned in it, that Chriſt appeareth no otherwiſe vnto him
but as an angrie iudge, as he hath hitherto beene painted out, and is ſo
beaten into the hearts of all by the wicked Papiſts, ſitting on the rayne
bowe, with a ſword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of his mouth. For this is one of the moſt
decietfull crafts of the deuell, yea and of his miſchiefes which he
practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth againſt the miſerable ſhepe, to daſle his eyes, that he may
not know any more his owne ſhepeheard, &amp; vnder a pretence of Chriſt to
leade a man to Moſes, diſputing as much of Chriſt, as he had accuſtomed
to do before of Moſes. Wherefore we haue neede of a ſtrong &amp; firme
faith, that we may beleeue theſe things to be true, when a man himſelfe
muſt diſpute euen againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For the ſenſe is veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
it ſelfe, whereunto the deuil alſo commeth maruelouſly amplifying ſynne
&amp; terrour, the greatnes and anguiſh whereof is able to conſume euen the
marrow in the bones, yea and the heart in the body. It can not therefore be
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly learned ſo ſoone as ſome thinke. In proſperitie it is
eaſilie beleeued that Chriſt is ſweete and amiable, but anguiſh and
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour comming vpon &amp; ouer whelming the minde, man is blinde and without
good vnderſtanding, and will iudge only according to the ſenſe and
vnderſtanding of his owne heart, which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and confirmeth
himſelfe in his owne errour. For he is taken therein, and can thinke no
otherwiſe, but that it is true, and neuertheles it is not true.</p>
            <p>Now it were a point of this art, for a man thus to ſay vnto his
heart,<note place="margin">How a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt ſpeake vnto his owne
heart.</note> if thou confes thy ſelfe to be a loſt ſheepe, thou
ſayeſt right: but that thou wilt therefore runne from Chriſt, and ſo
thinke of him in thy minde, as though he were a man, which would chaſe and
terrifie thee, it is a ſuggeſtion and tentation of the deuel. For if thou
didſt rightly conſider him, and confes him as thy true ſhepeheard, then
wouldeſt thou not flie from his ſight, neither <pb n="117" facs="tcp:9413:67"/>
wouldeſt conceiue terrour in thy minde, but with all cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and
boldnes wouldeſt runne vnto him. For ſurely he is not therefore ready at
hand that he may condemne thee, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to thee, ſeeking thee, that
hauing layde thee on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he may carie thee, and exempt &amp;
deliuer thee from ſinnes, errours, the deuill and his power, yea and from all
perill. Thou perceiueſt therefore that thou art a ſinner, and haſt
deſerued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo much more earneſtly is that ſhepeheard to be
ſought and called for of thee, that he may deliuer thee from it: of whom
conſider no otherwiſe in thy minde, then the ſhepe doth of his owne
ſhepeheard, whome it can not feare, but ſeing and hearing him becommeth
glad and cheereful, although it hath runne from him, ſo that for this deede
it hath a ſufficient cauſe to feare. The whole matter therefore
conſiſteth onely in this, that thou do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly learne Chriſt
aright,<note place="margin">We muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſt according to the word
of God.</note> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider him according to the word of God, and not
according to the proper cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of thy minde, and thine owne ſenſes.
For the cogitations of men are falſe and lying, but his wordes are true and
can not deceiue. Wherefore the worde alone is to be engrauen in our heart, and
we muſt cleaue vnto it with a conſtant mynde, whereby we may reproue our
owne heart of lying. For it alone muſt be true, and all things els that are
contrarie to it, falſe and vaine. But truly this is an arte, whereof I am
ignoraunt, but much more thoſe other light ſpirites, who boaſte many
thinges of it, as they that know all things, when as they haue euen once heard
any thing thereof, and neuertheles they do not a litle perceiue or trie ſo
much as any whit of it. For it is an eaſie thing to ſpeake and preach of
it, but how hard a thing it is to proue it in deede, they onely haue
experience, who earneſtly make triall thereof.</p>
            <p>This is a moſt amiable demonſtration of our Chriſt,
deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by himſelfe in this Goſpell, wherein he hath moſt
aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly poured forth the flames of his moſt feruent heart, and
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward vs, ſhewing that he hath exceeding great care and regard to
recouer his ſhepe, which alone leauing ninety and nine he ſeeketh and
enquireth diligently for, not to terrifie it and beate it, but that he may
helpe it, and hauing found it, may bring it home, and with his louing and
ſweete voice and ſpeaking vnto it may chere it being miſerable and
afflicted in conſcience. By all which thou ſeeſt, how acceptable a thing
thou ſhalt do vnto <pb n="118" facs="tcp:9413:68"/> him, if thou truſte and cleaue
vnto him with thy whole heart, and promiſe to thy ſelfe from him all
goodnes and loue.</p>
            <p>Secondly thou plainly ſeeſt this alſo, how by all maner of
outward ſignes &amp; meanes he poureth forth his ioy and vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
goodnes, and alſo hauing found his ſheepe how louing he ſheweth
himſelfe. For ſurely he dealeth not with it by any law, as by his right he
might deale, and driue it before him as he doth the reſt, or ſuffer it to
go by him. Howbeit he doth none of theſe, but layeth it vpon his ſhoulders,
and all the iourny carieth it through the deſert, taking all the labour and
trouble vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that at the leſt wiſe the ſheepe may reſt.
Neither doth he it grudginly but willingly, for he is full of ioy for his
ſheepe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. Now marke this alſo, how wel it goeth with the ſhepe,
with how great quietnes and eaſe it lyeth on his ſhepeheards ſhoulders,
neither doth it vnwillingly ſee it ſelfe reſting ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being
deliuered from the difficulty of the iourney, as alſo voyd of all feare both
of dogs and woulues, that is, of all errours and lyes, yea and of all perils
and miſchiefes. And this ſurely deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be called a very
pleaſaunt picture, exceeding amiable and comfortable to be looked vpon.</p>
            <p>No otherwiſe doth our Lord Ieſus Chriſt deale with vs,
whiles he deliuereth vs, which he hath once done corporally by his paſſion
and death, but now doth eftſoones the ſame by his power, and ſpiritually
by the preaching of his word. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he layeth vs vpon his ſhoulders,
carieth, and defendeth vs, ſo that we are ſafe from all perils of death and
the deuell, which albeit they terrifie vs, and ſhew themſelues ſo, as
though they would denour vs, yet preuaile they nothing. For whereas we are
caried, it is a ſafegard vnto vs, and the ſame exempteth vs from all
daungers, and putteth awaye all feare. As the ſhepe lying vpon the
ſhepeheards ſhoulders is litle careful, though the dogs barke much, and the
woulfe craftily goeth vp and downe, but rather hanging downe the head is quiet
and ſleepeth ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">If we beleue aſſuredly in
Chriſt Ieſus, we need not feare the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, rage he neuer ſo
ſore.</note> So we alſo, if we ſtand and abyde vnmoueably in this
article, I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, who ſuffred, died, roſe
againe for vs, &amp;c. there is no cauſe why we ſhould be carefull leſt
we periſh, or be deuoured of the deuell, though he open his iaws neuer ſo
wide. For we are not then in our own waye, neither walke we vpon our owne
feete, but we hange vpon the necke of <pb n="119" facs="tcp:9413:68"/> our ſhepeheard,
and lye vpon his ſhoulders, where we are ſafe enough. For ſinne, death,
and hell, although in deede they be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, yet dare they not ſet vpon
him, otherwiſe if it were not for this, we ſhould be miſerable ſhepe,
which ſhould forthwith be brought into a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table and wretched caſe. For
euen as a ſhepe can not take heede and foreſee to it ſelfe, that it
ſtray not out of the way, vnles it be led of the ſhepeheard, &amp; when it
hath ſtrayed and is loſt, can not by it ſelfe come againe to the
ſhepeheard, but muſt be ſought and enquired for of him, vntill he hath
found it, and ſo muſt be layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſhoulders and brought home againe,
leſt that it be againe frayed and chaſed from him, or catcht of the woulfe
and rent in pieces: So we alſo our ſelues can profite our ſelues neither
by helpe, nor counſel, that we might obtaine peace and quietnes of
conſcience, and eſcape out of the hands of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, death, and hell,
except Chriſt himſelfe repeat his word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and call vs againe vnto
him. And although we come vnto him, and now ſtand in faith, yet is it not in
our powre to keepe our ſelues therein, or to ſtand by our owne ſtrength,
vnles he eftſoones by the power of his Word, hold, lift vp, and carie vs, for
that the deuell alwayes imagineth and purpoſeth deceit and deſtruction
toward vs, and goeth about like a roring lyon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whom he may deuour,
as S. Peter witneſſeth. Wherefore here is no place to boaſt of free will,
or of our owne ſtrength, which is none, neither in beginning any thing,
neither in going forward therein, much leſſe in perſeuering or continuing
in it, but Chriſt our ſhepeheard alone doth all things.</p>
            <p>Howbeit we are ſure hereof, that whiles we lye vpon the
ſhoulders of Chriſt, we ſhall remayne ſafe from all terrour and
miſfortune. For he will not ſuffer vs to be plucked or taken from his
necke, neither will he himſelfe caſt vs of, being ſo glad and ioyfull,
that he hath found his loſt ſhepe, and brought it againe to the reſt of
the flocke. And in a ſumme, here is no terrour, or trouble, or exaction, but
mere life and grace, whereby he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his ſhepe moſt louingly and
gently. But on the contrarie Moſes, not as a ſhepeheard of miſerable and
weake ſheepe, but as a maiſter of ſtronger cattell, driueth his heards
with a ſtaffe and a rod three dayes iourney through the deſert, vntill they
be tyred and wearie with walking: of this ſhepeheard thoſe harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and
wilde ones are to be tamed and bridled. And we alſo, <pb n="120" facs="tcp:9413:69"/>
when we ſhalbe vnder Moſes, to wit, according to the fleſh and the
outward life, muſt goe, and do that which the law requireth. But in that we
are, and are called Chriſtians, we muſt by no meanes ſuffer, that any
worke be layed vpon vs, yea or exacted of vs, but muſt giue our ſelues
onely to Chriſt to be caried and gentlely lifted vp, not vpon horſes and
charrets, but euen vpon his onely ſhoulders.<note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt
carieth vs v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> Which commeth to paſſe, as I haue
ſayd, when he ſuffreth the word to be preached vnto vs, and we alſo
beleeue the ſame, that he died for vs, that on the croſſe he bare our
ſinnes in his body, that he hath ouerthrowne the deuell, death, and ſynnes,
and put them vnder his feete, and hath made and opened vnto vs entraunce to
eternall life. Wherefore we muſt not haue reſpect to our owne life, how
righteous and ſtrong we are, but we muſt ſtudie vpon his one thing, that
we may reſt lying vpon his ſhoulders. In this circle we muſt haue no care
of ſynne, death, life, or penſiuenes, inaſmuch as we haue all things to
the full in Chriſt, who beareth and keepeth vs.</p>
            <p>Now he is not content with all theſe things, both that with
ſuch great trauell he ſeeketh his ſhepe, and alſo that hauing found
it,<note place="margin">Exceeding ioy becauſe of the ſheepe which was loſt
and is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againe.</note> he carieth it with incredible ioy, but it being
brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he maketh feſtiual dayes, &amp; exceedingly reioyceth,
calling togither his neighbours and friendes that they may reioyce with him.
Yea he affirmeth, that God alſo in heauen with the whole heauenly hoſt do
reioyce ouer one ſynner that repenteth. In which wordes he ſheweth and
declareth, who he is, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth to be called his loſt ſhepe,
namely ſuch a ſynner, as being led by repentaunce of his former life, doth
amend, moſt feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſyring to be deliuered from ſynnes, and
earneſtly endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to come vnto Chriſt: ſuch a one hath a miſerable
and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, yea and a contrite and humbled heart, and an afflicted
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which the deuell by all meanes fighteth againſt, and ſo
preſſeth it, that it is almoſt ouercome with diſtreſſes, &amp;c.
But Chriſt aſſiſteth and comforteth him, for he is ſuch a man, as
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no ſhepe but that which is loſt, and can not helpe it
ſelfe.</p>
            <p>How may Chriſt be preached with greater gentlenes, and more
effectuall conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of words? or what thinkeſt thou ſhould he do more
to cheere the mind of a ſinner, and to confirme in him a ſure confidence
toward himſelfe? For we ſee him ſet forth by himſelfe to vs miſerable
ſynners as a moſt louing ſhepeheard, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:9413:69"/> who moſt
ſorrowfully ſeeketh his ſheepe being loſt, and moſt ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bringeth them againe being found, and taketh ſo great ioy, that with him all
the Angells alſo and Sainctes doe reioyce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs.</p>
            <p>Now he that could firmely beleeue theſe thinges, ſhould
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dout through Chriſt receiue true comfort and ioy, foraſmuch as
here he hath a certaine promiſe, that if he ſurely cleaue vnto Chriſt,
and reſt vpon his ſhoulders, he ſhall be an acceptable and welcome
gueſt in the kingdom of heauen, and ſhall be receyued with exceeding great
ioye. But we being troubled with ſorrowe and anguiſh of conſcience, haue
a farre other feeling and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when as the hart can thinke nothing
elſe, but that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells doe ſtand behind vs with a drawne ſword,
which feare ſo troubleth vs, that we can conceiue no cheerefulnes in our
minde, neither of God, nor of the Angells. And there are ſome alſo, which
can behold no creature with a glad minde, fearing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the
ſunne, yea being ſore afraid at the noyſe of a leafe. All which proceede
from hence, for that they trouble and vexe them ſelues with their owne
thoughtes, out of which they would willingly wraſtle, ſparing no labour,
that they might feele that vprightnes and integritie in them, which would be
abaſhed with no feare. But if thou be deſirous to conceiue true comfort and
ioye in thy hart, then ſee that thou doe diligently and well print and
faſten therein this amiable image of the moſt louing ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and the
word of the Goſpell, and ſeeke it, where it is to be ſought, that is, in
Chriſt and no where elſe:<note place="margin">In Chriſt true ioy is to be

did begin. For vnles ſhe had beleued that ſhe alſo might be made partaker
of Chriſtes bountifulnes and goodnes, ſhee would not haue ſo followed
him, or cried after him. Which is that wherof we haue often admoniſhed,<note place="margin">Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing.</note> &amp; which we are taught Rom.
10. that faith is by hearing. Wherefore the word ought alwayes to goe before,
and giue the beginning of ſaluation. But how came it to paſſe, whereas
many other alſo heard the ſame report of our Sauiour Ieſus, yet they
followed him not, yea they quite deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that report? I aunſwere. They
that are not ſicke, as they haue no neede of the Phiſitian, ſo neither
are they deſirous of him. But this woman was afflicted and felt her
neceſſitie, yea that report was ſo ioyfull vnto her, that ſhe being
ſtirred vp thereby, did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt, running after ſuch a pleaſant
ſauour. Cant. 1.<note place="margin">We muſt firſt by the law come to the
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſinne, before we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taſt howe ſweete
Chriſt is.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Moſes muſt alway goe before, who may teach vs
to feele ſinne, whereby grace may be wiſhed for and deſired of vs. It is
in vaine therefore, although Chriſt be preached to be louing, and to be
deſired and longed for, if a man be not before humbled through knowledge of
him ſelfe, and made deſirous of Chriſt, according to the ſonge of
Marie: <hi>The Lorde hath filled the hungrie with good thinges, and the rich he
hath ſent emptie away.</hi> Nowe all theſe thinges are written for the
conſolation &amp; lifting vp of them which be miſerable, poore, needie,
oppreſſed with ſinnes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, that they may knowe to whom they may
flie in all diſtres, and where they may ſeeke for helpe and ſafetie.</p>
            <p>But ſee howe Chriſt vrgeth and inflameth faith in them that be
his, whereby they may become ſtronger and more confirmed. For firſt,
whereas this woman being encouraged with that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring fame of his, goeth
after him, and cryeth for helpe, douting <pb n="124" facs="tcp:9413:71"/> nothing but
ſhe ſhould trie him to be ſuch a one, as ſhe had heard him reported to
be, and that ſhe ſhould forthwith entreat him for the recouerie of her
daughter: Chriſt in all reſpects ſheweth him ſelfe vnto her ſo, as
though he would deceiue all her truſt, and make his report falſe ſo that
ſhe might thinke with her ſelfe: Is this that man which is ſo bountiful
and readie to helpe all? Doth he ſo fulfill the moſt commendable report
which goeth of him? Where doth there appeare ſo much as any thing like vnto
thoſe thinges, which men haue told me of him? They were deceiued them
ſelues and deceiued me alſo. He ſheweth him ſelfe an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie rather
then a friende. Why doth he not ſo much as ſpeake a word, and friendly
denie me helpe, if I be vnworthy thereof? He holdeth his peace like vnto a
blocke, &amp; vouchſafeth not to ſpeake a word, neither offereth his help.
Here ſurely Chriſt gaue a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous blow to the minde of the ſilly woman.
So it is an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torment to them that beleeue, being in diſtres,
when God ſheweth him ſelfe ſuch a one at their prayers, like vnto one
that is angrie, and whom they pray vnto in vayne, hiding ſo deepely his
grace, that they now perceiue nothing els, but that he will not performe
thoſe thinges which he hath promiſed, and that ſo he will ſhew his owne
wordes to be falſe. That truely hapned to the Iſraelites at the red ſea,
and to many other excellent holy men.<note place="margin">The conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of
this woman of Canaan.</note> But what doth this woman to theſe things? She
remoueth out of her ſight &amp; mind, that Chriſt ſhewed him ſelfe ſo
vngentle and hard to be intreated, ſhe being conſtant and nothing moued
hereat, perſeuereth in the truſt of his goodnes, whereof ſhe had heard,
and which ſhe had conceiued in her minde, ſuffering her ſelfe in no
wiſe to be turned from it.<note place="margin">We muſt not ceaſſe to
truſt in God, though he ſeemeth at the firſt not to heare our prayers,
nor to fulfill his promiſe.</note> So alſo muſt we do, we muſt truſt
vnto the word alone, although God him ſelfe and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures pretende
otherwiſe then the worde preacheth. But this is thriſe moſt hard to
nature &amp; reaſon, to be ſo vtterly deſtitute, and to depend on the
word of God without any feeling of comfort, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when a man feeleth and trieth
all things to be contrary. God giue vnto vs ſuch a mind and faith, that we
may ſo doe, eſpecially at the point of death and in extreme
neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the cry and faith of this woman ſeemeth to
haue ſuffered repulſe, the diſciples come with their faith, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not
but that they ſhal entreat the Lord, but when they thinke that they ſhall
make him more eaſie to be entreated, they find him <pb n="125" facs="tcp:9413:71"/> to
be much more harde, repelling as it appeared, and as they thought, the faith
and prayers both of the woman &amp; alſo of them ſelues. Neither doth
Chriſt here hold his peace, and leaue them in doubte, as before, but he
ſeemeth plainely to deny that which they aſke, ſaying: <hi>I am not
ſent but to the loſt sheepe of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> This ſtroke
is much more grieuous then that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, where not onely the perſon of the
intreater is repelled, but al hope alſo which is wont to be left, is cut of,
namely the comfort of the interceſſion of all the other Saintes and elect.
For it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the laſt refuge to them that ſuffer diſtres and feele
the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation of God, to get them ſelues to godly &amp; holy men,
ſeeking for comfort and helpe, whereunto, as charitie requireth, they find
them ready and willing, but euen they alſo ſome time doe in vaine aſke
helpe and ſuccour, for neither are they heard, and ſo the caſe of them
that be in diſtres becommeth worſe and more lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So the afflicted
and deſolate may truely obiect vnto Chriſt all thoſe wordes, wherein he
hath promiſed that he will heare his Sainctes, as:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.19</note> 
               <hi>If two of you shall agree in
earth vpon any thing whatſoeuer they shall deſire, it shall be giuen them
of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen.</hi> Againe, <hi>VVhatſoeuer ye shall
aske,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 11.24</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and ye
shall receiue it.</hi> And many ſuch like. But if to him that obiecteth
theſe thinges, and aſketh him howe he can goe from his wordes and
promiſes, he aunſwere thus: I goe not from my promiſes, I haue not
promiſed that I will heare all prayers, but the prayers of them that be myne,
which are of the houſe of Iſraell, not of all whatſoeuer. What thinkeſt
thou may the hart then thinke hauing taken ſuch a repulſe? Such an
aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is as it were a flaſh of lightning, wherewith the hart and all
truſt is ſeuered and broken in a thouſand peeces. For what truſt can
there be left, when he heareth that that doth not pertaine vnto him, which
becauſe of the word of God he truſted to haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, but vnto others.
Here not ſo much as a worde can be left, if one doe according as he feeleth.
But what doth this woman? She doth not ſo fall from hope,<note place="margin">The great conſtancie &amp; faith of this woman of Canaan.</note>
ſhe ſtill ſticketh to the wordes which ſhe had heard of Chriſt,
albeit he went about by this other repulſe as with a certaine force to
wreſt them out of her hart, ſhe ſuffereth not her ſelf to be fraied
away neither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that vngentle ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, neither with this hard aunſwere,
ſhee continueth ſtedfaſtly in a ſure confidence, beleeuing that vnder
this difficultie which <pb n="126" facs="tcp:9413:72"/> Chriſt did pretend, that grace
was as yet hidden and layd vp for her, which ſhe had heard reported of him,
ſhee can not be brought as yet to iudge Chriſt not to be bountiful and
gracious, and that he can deny the helpe which ſhee deſireth. This was to
perſeuer ſtrongly in faith.</p>
            <p>Moreouer ſhe followeth Ieſus euen into the houſe, as Marke
writeth, ſhe is inſtant vpon him, falleth downe before him, and ſayth:
<hi>Lord helpe me.</hi> Here the Lorde giueth a deadly &amp; the laſt blow
ſaying vnto her face, that ſhe is a dogge, and vnworthy to be partaker of
the bread of the children. What may ſhe aunſwere hereunto? For he ſeemed
to ſignifie in theſe wordes that ſhe is of the number of the damned and
deſperat, which can looke for no part with the elect. This word ſeemeth
eternall and that can not be gaineſayd: For he which doth not pertaine to the
companie of the elect by the ordinaunce of God, what may he hope to be left for
him? This woman is not yet diſcouraged and paſt hope, but yeldeth to this
iudgement of the Lord, ſhe confeſſeth of her owne accorde, that ſhe is
a dogge, neither deſireth ſhe any thing but that which is wont to be giuen
to dogges, namely the crummes which fall from their maiſters table. Seemeth
ſhe not to haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed maruelous cunning? She taketh Chriſt in his owne
wordes. He had made her like vnto a dogge, ſhe acknowledgeth it, and
deſireth that he will onely ſuffer her to be a dogge according to his owne
ſaying: what ſhould he here do? how ſhould he eſcape? he was now as it
were euen taken. For the crummes vnder the table are graunted to the dogge, for
vnto dogges they are ſayd to be due.<note place="margin">The frute of
conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeuerance &amp; truſt in Chriſt.</note> Here therefore
Chriſt being as it were ouercome, doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen him ſelfe wholy, and graunteth
the deſires of the woman, and maketh that ſhe is not now a dogge, but a
true Iſraelite.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are written for the inſtruction and comfort of
all vs, whereby we ought to learne, howe deepely ſometime Chriſt hideth his
grace from vs, and how we muſt not iudge of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our owne
ſenſe and opinion, but onely according to his wordes. For we ſee here,
that albeit Chriſt ſhewed him ſelfe very hard to this woman, yet he did
not plainely deny to helpe her, but whatſoeuer he aunſwered, howſoeuer it
ſeemed to pretend a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, yet was it not a deniall, but did hange in
dout, and left an entraunce for faith, although but ſmall. For he ſayd not
at her firſt petition: I will not heare her, but he held his peace, neither 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:9413:72"/> promiſing nor denying helpe. So to the ſecond
petition, which the Apoſtles made, he ſayth not: ſhe is not of the
houſe of Iſrael, I can not therefore performe that which ſhe deſireth,
but he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayth: <hi>I am not ſent, but to the loſt sheepe of the
houſe of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſraell,</hi> leauing all thinges in doute, and in the middeſt
betweene a plaine graunt and a deniall. So when ſhe had the third time
deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, he ſayth not: thou art a dogge, get thee hence, the bread of
the children is not due vnto thee, but he ſayth: <hi>It is not good to take
the childrens bread, &amp;c.</hi> againe leauing in dout, whether ſhe was a
dogge or no. Neuertheles all theſe ſayinges doe pretende outwardly rather a
deniall of helpe, then prouoke her to hope, but in very deede they did containe
in them rather a promiſe and hope, then a deniall. Yea there was nothing but
a promiſe and a certaine expectation of helpe, (howbeit moſt deepely hid
and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither ſecret) vnder that ſilence and aunſwers, although they
were hard, and a deniall onely ſounded outwardly. By theſe it is ſhewed
how our hart is wont to be affected in tentation. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as that
feeleth in tentation, ſo Chriſt here behaueth him ſelfe. It feeleth all
thinges to be denied, when as it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Wherefore it is
requiſite, that leauing it owne feeling, by a ſure faith in the word of God
it conceiue and hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of helpe, deepely hidden vnder the
deniall, and yeeld vnto the ſentence of God toward vs, as this woman did,
ſo ſhall we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and take the Lord in his wordes, that he can not but
helpe vs. So that if we feele in our conſcience at any time God rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs,
pronouncing vs ſinners, and vnworthy of the kingdom of heauen, then we feele
as it were hell, and it ſeemeth vnto vs that we are paſt all hope and
recouerie for euer:<note place="margin">When God pronounceth vs ſinners, we
ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe our ſinnes, &amp; pray former eye,
which God hath promiſed to them that be penitent for their ſinnes.</note>
then if any had the ſkill of this woman, that he could take the Lord in his
owne iudgement and ſay: yea Lord, I am a ſinner, and altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of thy grace, but thou haſt promiſed forgiuenes to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, neither
didſt thou come to call the righteous, but as Paule ſayth, to ſaue
ſinners: he truely ſhoulde bringe to paſſe that the Lorde ſhould be
enforced, euen by his owne iudgement to haue mercy vpon him. So did
Manaſſes, when being penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for pardon, as we read in his
prayer: He yeelded to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, acknowledging him ſelfe a moſt
grieuous ſinner, and ſo he bound God with his promiſe, which had
promiſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſinne to ſinners, not to the righteous. The
ſame alſo <pb n="128" facs="tcp:9413:73"/> did Dauid obſerue Pſal. 51.
<hi>Againſt thee onely,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>haue I ſinned, and done this
euill in thy ſight, that thou mighteſt be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in thy ſaying, and
found pure when thou art iudged.</hi> For that doth purchaſe vnto vs all
diſpleaſure, that we diſdayne to ſuffer the iudgement of the Lord, and
doe againſt our wills yeeld vnto his ſentence, when he pronounceth vs
ſinners. Such a great thing is it to acknowledge ſinnes, and to embrace the
iudgement of God. We all confeſſe our ſelues ſinners in words, but as
ſoone as the Lorde ſpeaketh that in our hart, and pronounceth vs
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we doe not abide by that which before we confeſſed, we had
leuer be counted righteous and free from that iudgement. But it muſt needes
be, if God muſt be iuſt in his wordes, that thou be a ſinner, then alſo
maiſt thou vſe the right of ſinners, which God him ſelfe hath giuen
vnto them, namely to pray with a ſure expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of forgiuenes of ſinnes.
Then is it not permitted vnto thee onely to feede vnder the table of crummes
after the maner of dogges, but being a child of the houſhold, thou ſhalt
ſit at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry table, hauing God nowe howe great ſoeuer he be, giuen vnto
thee according to thy deſire. Hereof alſo we haue an hiſtoricall
expoſition of this text according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> allegories. For as it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to
this woman her daughter being ſicke, for whom through faith ſhe obtayned
health by a miracle: ſo alſo falleth it out with vs, when we are deliuered
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall ſicknes to wit ſinnes, which truely are a moſt
grieuous and troubleſom Deuill vnto vs. For as ſhe acknowledged her ſelfe
a dogge, ſo muſt we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues ſinners and iudged vnto
hell, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing it, which if we can doe as ſhe coulde, we ſhall
be ſafe. We haue already ſpoken elſewhere of other thinges, whereof there
might be occaſion to ſpeake out of this text, as howe one may obtaine grace

            <p>This word, <hi>appeared,</hi> we haue elſewhere declared to
ſignifie the reuelation of the Goſpell, whereby Chriſt appeared in the
world: Albeit the vnſkilfulnes of Miniſters hath wreſted it to the
carnall natiuitie of Chriſt. He vſeth not here the word <hi>grace,</hi>
which he vſed before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.</note> but hath
ſet in ſteed therof two other words of maruelous comfort,
<hi>[bountifulnes, and loue toward men]</hi> which he attributeth to our God.
The firſt is called of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>Chreſtotes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bountifulnes</note> and is that kindnes, gentlenes and ſweetenes
of conditions, wherewith they that be endued, with them all of vs are with
pleaſure conuerſant, &amp; maruelouſly delighted with their companie,
ſo that they doe with this their gentlenes and kindnes allure &amp; greatly
prouoke all men to loue them. For ſuch can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all without griefe: they
contemne no man: they repell or put none from them with bitter, hard, and
diſordered conditions: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe vnto them is not hard, but they are ſo
open, and ready for al, that euery one dare reſort vnto them, and deſire
their helpe. And to conclude: they are ſuch men as the Goſpells deſcribe
Chriſt vnto vs, whom they declare to be gentle to all, a deſpiſer of
none, which denieth no benefit to any, pliant, prepared and ready to do good to
all. So God alſo by the Goſpell is preached and offered vnto vs wholy good,
bountifull and ſweete, open to all, reiecting none, bearing all our ſinnes
and offences, repelling no man from him with exceſſiue ſeueritie. For we
read and heare nothing to be declared in the Goſpell but meere grace, and
meere goodnes, <pb n="131" facs="tcp:9413:74"/> whereby he doth moſt mercifully beare
vs, &amp; moſt gently handle vs, and not any man according to his deſerts.
This is the time of grace, wherein it is graunted to all to goe with great
boldnes vnto the throne of grace, as it is written Heb. 4. and Pſal. 34:
<hi>Come vnto him, and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be
ashamed,</hi> that is, he will not ſuffer you to pray and come in vaine,
neither to returne with confuſion being fruſtrate.</p>
            <p>The other word is <hi>Philanthropia,</hi> loue of men,<note place="margin">Loue toward men.</note> as couetouſnes may be called loue of
money, as Dauid 2. Sam. 1. calleth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of women, the loue of women.
And the Philoſophers cal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine liuing creatures <hi>Philanthropa,</hi>
that is louing toward men, as are horſes, dogges, dolphins. For theſe
creatures are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture delighted with man, they deſire his company, &amp;
do willingly ſerue him, as though they were moued with ſome reaſon &amp;
ſenſe of humanity. This name, &amp; ſuch loue the Apoſtle here
attributeth to our God, which Moſes alſo did before him, Deut. 33: where he
ſpeaketh thus of God: <hi>The Lord appeared hauing in his right hand a law of
fire, and he loued the people.</hi> The meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Apoſtle is
this: Our God hath in the Goſpell ſhewed him ſelfe vnto vs not onely
bountifull, kinde, gentle, and ſweete, which can beare, and will receiue all,
but alſo he ſo loueth vs, that of his owne accord he adioyneth him ſelf
vnto vs, ſeeketh to haue to doe with vs, voluntarily ſheweth and offereth
his grace and bountifulnes vnto vs, and moſt gently embraceth as many as
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe not refuſe his grace and loue, and deſire to drawe nie vnto him.
What ſhould he doe more? Who can not ſee hereby, why we count the Goſpell
a preaching, ioyfull and full of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in Chriſt? For
what can be ſpoken more louingly and ſweetely to a ſinnefull and
afflicted conſcience, then theſe wordes? O lamentable caſe, how
miſerably hath Satan by the lawes of his Pope oppreſſed and obſcured
this ſouereigne ſynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the word of God.</p>
            <p>Now let no man reſtraine theſe two wordes <hi>[bountifulnes,
&amp; loue toward men]</hi> to the perſons,<note place="margin">No reſpect of
perſons with God.</note> for God is plainly without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons
bountifull to all, and a louer of all, otherwiſe if we ſhoulde here make a
difference betweene men, we ſhoulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſome thing is
receiued through our merits, and not all thinges through his mercy. Where it
muſt be well mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that God is ſayd to be a louer of men, not of this or
that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <pb n="132" facs="tcp:9413:75"/> onely, not held with loue of the perſon,
and therefore theſe two, <hi>bountifulnes, and loue toward men,</hi> muſt
be taken after a generall ſort, that in all thinges the chiefe praiſe may
be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his mercy, that no man truſt in his owne merits, neither be
terrified with ſinnes, but that all togither doe truſt to his grace, which
he voluntarily offereth vnto vs with ſo great kindnes and loue toward vs. For
if any reſpect of perſon might be had here, it ſhould ſurely be had of
them, which are rich in the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, but Paul expreſſely
reiecteth theſe, ſaying: <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſnes, which we
had done.</hi> Howe much leſſe then ſhall this bountifulnes and loue of
our God toward men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, becauſe of any mans wiſedome, power,
nobilitie, riches or any ſuch thing, when as no reſpect is had of works of
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? Great is the grace of God toward vs, which appeareth in the
Goſpell, yea and nothing but grace, which admitteth no merit at all of ours,
vtterly taketh away all boaſting and glorying, and ſetteth forth the glory
of God alone, who freely giueth it vnto vs being vnworthy. So in this text
theſe two, faith and loue, are taught to receiue benefits of God, and
beſtow them on our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which the Scripture doth very often repeate,
ſo that euen the doctrine of ſaluation conſiſteth wholy in them,<note place="margin">The doctrin of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in faith and
loue.</note> neither can one be ſeparated from the other. For he that doth
not firmely truſt in the diuine grace, can not but be remiſſe and ſlow
to doe well to his neighbour, and ſo witnes the faintnes and weakenes of
faith, which is the fountaine of all duties and benefites: As contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the ſtronger faith that one is endued with, ſo much more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and
with readier minde he endeuoureth to deſerue well of his neighbours.</p>
            <p>All both doctrine and life worthy of Chriſt, (that all thinges
may be declared moſt briefly, manifeſtly and ſufficiently) conſiſt of
theſe two,<note place="margin">By faith and loue man is made as it were a meane
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene God &amp; his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> faith and loue. Whereby man is made
as it were a meane betwene God and his neighbours, that he may receiue of God
from aboue, and may giue to his neighbours beneath, &amp; be as it were a
conduit pipe, through which the fountaine of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine goodnes doth
continually flow to his neighbours. And ſuch men are like vnto God, which in
Chriſt receiue of God whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he hath, and doe againe by their good
deedes declare them ſelues as it were the gods of other, and fullfill the
prophecie of the Prophet Pſalme 82: <hi>I haue ſayde, ye are gods, and 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9413:76"/> ye all are children of the moſt high.</hi> We are
children of the moſt high by faith, whereby of nothinge we are made the
heires of God. And we are gods by loue, which maketh vs beneficiall to our
neighbour: foraſmuch as the nature of God is nothinge but bountifulnes, and
Paul here ſayth: the bountifulnes and loue of God toward men,<note place="margin">The meanes to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the bountifulnes and loue of God is
to beleeue.</note> which he doth with incomparable plentie daily poure forth
vpon euery one, as we ſee. We muſt onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, that euery one doe
nothing doubt that theſe thinges are ſpoken to him, that the bountifulnes
and loue of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is reuealed and offered to euery one, that by
theſe wordes he may eſtabliſh, exerciſe, and ſtrengthen his faith,
being certain that they are moſt true, and that God both vndoutedly is, and
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes will be bountifull and louing toward him. If thou canſt beleeue
this, it will aſſuredly ſo come vnto thee: thou maiſt then with a full
confidence pray and deſire of him whatſoeuer thou wilt, and complayne vnto
him of whatſoeuer doth grieue thee or other. But if thou want this faith, it
had bene better for thee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to haue heard any thing hereof, for that by thy
infidelity thou reproueſt of falſhood theſe wordes ſo precious and full
of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and grace, making ſo light account of them, as not
belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that they be true. Which ſurely is a great contempt and
diſhonour of God, that ſcarce a more grieuous ſinne can be committed of
thee. Contrariwiſe if thou be endued with this faith, it can not be, but that
thy hart being thereby cheered, ſhould euen as it were laughe and leape for
holy ioy in God, being void of all care and trouble, and be made aboue
meaſure confident. For how can any diſcouragement, any whit of ſorrowe
remayne in that hart, which douteth not that God is gracious and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto it, and beareth a ſingular affection of loue toward it, that it is a
delight and pleaſure vnto him to doe it good, and enioy it as a friende?
Surely the hart is neceſſarily delighted with this ſpirituall ioy and
pleaſure, or vndoutedly it wanteth faith. Paule in the Epiſtle to the Gal.
calleth this, to receiue the holy Ghoſt by the Goſpell. For the Goſpell
is ſo pleaſant a preaching of the grace and goodnes of God, that while it
is preached and heard, it bringeth the holy Ghoſt with it, no otherwiſe
then the beames of the ſunne doe naturally bring heat with them.</p>
            <p>How could the Apoſtle vſe more pleaſaunt and ſweete words?
I dare ſay that I haue in the whole Scripture redde none more 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9413:77"/> pleaſaunt, and ſo ſweete words of the grace of God,
as theſe two, <hi>Chreſtotes, &amp; Philanthropia,</hi> that is,
<hi>bountifulnes, and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How louing God
is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs.</note> in which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God is ſo deſcribed, as wherby
he doth not onely forgiue our ſinnes, but doth alſo deſire to be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaunt with vs, and is ready to doe the part of a very friend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vs, voluntarily offering him ſelfe to helpe vs in al thinges, alſo to
beſtowe more benefits vpon vs then we can deſire or aſke, that we may
preſume of him no otherwiſe then of a moſt neare &amp; familiar friend,
of whom we may obtayne all thinges, in whoſe eyes we are moſt deare, and
euen delightfull. Thinke in thy minde of a moſt perfect friend, which hath
fulfilled all the partes of friendſhip toward thee, &amp; thou ſhalt haue
after a ſort a forme, although yet farre vnlike, of the diuine goodnes and
kindenes, which is here attributed to our God, by the name of bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and
loue toward men. But when thou haſt a ſounde faith in this bountifulnes and
loue to manward, and thereby dooſt liue in thy God, ſo bountifull,
gracious, and gentle to thee, reioyceſt, and art full of all good thinges,
being certayne of his continuall grace, what ſhouldeſt thou doe any longer
in earth? what in this life?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He that is partaker of the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and

ſurely that loue of God and pleaſure which thou enioyeſt in him will not
ſuffer thee to be idle. Thou ſhalt be enflamed with a marueilous ſtudy
and deſire to doe what things ſoeuer thou canſt know will be an honour
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy God, ſo louing and bountifull vnto thee, and will turne to
praiſe, glory, and thankes giuing vnto him. Thou ſhalt haue no choiſe of

compulſion of the law, hauing a moſt ready will and pleaſure to doe,
whatſoeuer thinges thou ſhalt know to be acceptable vnto God, whether they
be contemptible or noble, ſmall or great, thou ſhalt count them alike. But
firſt of all it ſhall be thy deſire, that this bleſſed knowledge of
God may be common alſo to the reſt, whereupon by and by thy loue will here
ſhew it ſelfe, and will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay all meanes, to make this truth of

of the world wil condemne thee of hereſie and madnes, and will leaue no meane

Thus with Chriſt thy Lord thou ſhalt be perſecuted, &amp; ſuffer
extreme igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie, thy body, life, goods, name, friendes, and all things being
brought into perill, vntill they haue thruſt thee from them out of this life
into the eternal &amp; bleſſed life: In the meane ſeaſon thou muſt
ſuffer all theſe things with a patient mind, and take them in good part,
loſing none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpiritual ioy, which thou haſt of Chriſt in thy God,
&amp; for thy part ſhewing to thy perſecutors all kindnes and loue, being
alwayes mindful, that thou a litle before waſt not much vnlike them before
God. All which thinges thou ſhalt doe through faith &amp; loue, albeit they
exceede the ſtrength of nature. And this in deede is a true Chriſtian life,
wherein thou dooſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to doe ſo to other, as God hath done to
thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not by the workes of righteouſnes which we had done.</hi> In
theſe words the Apoſtle ſignifieth that which we haue now ſayd, and
proueth it as it were by rendring a reaſon.<note place="margin">We muſt do
well vnto men, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen though they haue not ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs.</note>
For if the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes and loue of God to manward hath appeared, &amp; he
hath ſaued vs of his mercie, and not becauſe of our owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
yea we being by all meanes vnworthy, and ſubiect to innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſinnes, it
is meete that we alſo do good to them that haue not deſerued ſo much of
vs, &amp; are vnworthy therof. For we which are become the ſonnes of God,
muſt reſemble God our father, and beſtow benefits according to our
abilitie as well vpon our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and perſecutours, as vpon our friendes and
them that do good vnto vs. Wherof Chriſt alſo hath admoniſhed vs Matth.
5: <hi>Loue your enemies, that ye may be the children of your Father which is
in heauen, who maketh his ſunne to shine vppon the good &amp; euill, &amp;
ſendeth raine on the iuſt &amp; vniuſt. For if ye loue them which loue
you, vvhat revvard shal ye haue? vvhen as euen the heathen &amp; Publicans doe
the ſame.</hi> Nowe the Apoſtle doth not onely expreſſely condemne vs
for euill works, but ſayth: <hi>Not by the vvorks of righteouſnes,</hi> or,
<hi>which vve haue done in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.</hi> Where he alſo reiecteth
thoſe workes, which we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous, and were thought both of vs &amp;

being righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, that they made vs more vnworthy of the grace of God, and 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9413:76"/> more vnfit to receiue it, for they are deceitfull workes,
whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we adde this ſinne, that we thinke them righteous, and truſt in

ſinne and doe vniuſtly. But euen as God, when we being vnwiſe, by errour
moued him to anger, counting our ſinnes workes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, did not
therefore reiect vs, but of his mercie deliuered vs from this errour and
ſinnes: ſo we neglecting the fooliſhnes and dotage of our aduerſaries,
whereby they contend that ſinnes are to be counted for righteouſnes, ought
neuertheles of meere loue, hauing no reſpect of euill or good deſerts, to
be beneficiall vnto them, and endeuour to doe them good in all thinges, looking
for frute of our benefits not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of God alone. Let theſe things
ſuffize to haue bene ſpoken for a compendious and generall expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of
this text.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs alſo briefly wey the wordes, wherein he ſetteth
forth and commendeth the grace of God. Firſt he ſo greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth
it,<note place="margin">The good workes and righteouſnes of men how they are
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of.</note> that in reſpect of it he condemneth all our good
workes and righteouſnes: neither doth he condemne a ſmall thing, when he
condemneth our righteouſnes or righteous workes, the moſt excellent thinge
that man can haue in earth. For if all men with all their might ſhould labour
and endeuour to attayne to moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act prudence, wiſedom, and libertie of
minde and will, which we reade that ſome Philoſophers and Princes haue
done, as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Traianus, and many other, whoſe ſame the whole world
hath long ſince ſpred abroade both by wordes and writinges: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
all ſuch wiſedome, and all ſuche vertues are nothinge but ſinnes before
God, foraſmuch as they be not done in and by the grace of God. Doers of
ſuch vertues are ignoraunt of God, and therefore they can not honour him by
their ſtudies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, they thinke they haue all thinkes of them
ſelues, when as no man can haue any good thinge at all, but of this grace
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which the Goſpell preacheth. So Paule glorieth, that he, before he
knewe Chriſt, liued a blameleſſe life, and was more zealous towarde the
lawe then thoſe of his age, that he alſo thought, that he did a thing
acceptable to God by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chriſtians, which condemned that
blameles life which he ledde, but afterwarde when he had learned Chriſt, he
ſayth, <pb n="137" facs="tcp:9413:78"/> that he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth that righteouſnes to be but
dounge, that he might be found not in ſuch righteouſnes, but in Chriſt by
faith. Philip. 3. The ſame thing he witneſſeth and entreateth of at large
in the Epiſtles to the Galathians and Coloſſians. Here therefore is
condemned all boaſting of free will, mans ſtrength, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and
good workes, and it is concluded, that they are all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſinnes, and
certaine deſtruction, although they haue a fayre ſhew: that we are ſaued
by the onely grace of God, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs as beleeue, and call for it, with
acknowledging of our owne vanitie and perdition.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt accuſtome our ſelues to the Scripture,<note place="margin">Tow ſortes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> which maketh mention of
two ſorts of rigteouſnes, one humane, which Paul here and in many other
places hath mentioned, the other diuine, euen that grace of ſaluation, which
iuſtifieth vs by faith,<note place="margin">Diuine righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes whereby we
are iuſtified.</note> whereof he ſpeaketh in the ende of this text:
<hi>That being iuſtified by grace, we should be heires of eternall life.</hi>
Here thou ſeeſt plainly that the grace of God is our true righteouſnes,
whereby we are iuſtified, which is therfore called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of God,
for that it is giuen vnto vs of God, and is made ours, when we are made
partakers thereof by faith. Of this he ſpeaketh alſo Rom. 1: <hi>In the
Goſpell is reuealed the righteouſnes of God from faith to faith, as it is
written: The iuſt shall liue by faith.</hi> And Gen. 15: <hi>Abraham
beleeued, and it was counted to him for righteouſnes.</hi> Whereupon the
Scripture concludeth, that no man is counted righteous before God, but he that
beleeueth, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, where he reciteth that ſaying of
Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuc: <hi>The iuſt shal liue by faith.</hi> So it appeareth that faith,
grace, mercye, truth, righteouſnes, that all theſe are that ſame which
God worketh in vs by Chriſt and the Goſpell. Whereupon it is ſaid Pſal.
25: <hi>All the wayes of the Lord are mercie and truth.</hi> For thoſe are
the wayes of the Lord in which we obſeruing his commaundements, do walke, and
he againe in vs, now thoſe wayes muſt be directed by his mercie and truth
alone, not by our ſtrength and induſtrie, foraſmuch as our wayes being
orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereby, are nothing but vanitie before God, and do deſerue his
wrath. According to that which the Lord ſayth Eſai 55: <hi>As farre as the
heauen is higher then the earth, ſo farre do my waies exceede yours.</hi> As
if he ſhould ſay: Your righteouſnes is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of no value,
wherefore ye muſt bid it farewell and walke <pb n="138" facs="tcp:9413:79"/> in myne, if
ye hope for ſaluation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But according to his mercie he ſaued vs.</hi> It is maruell
how the credit of theſe wordes can ſtand, wherein the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that we are alreadie ſaued, although liuing yet in earth, and therefore in
continuall miſerie. But he did ſo ſpeake, that he might more fully
expreſſe the power of the diuine grace, and the nature of faith againſt
hypocrites, who as though ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were yet farre of, do in vaine endeuour
to get and obtaine it by their workes.<note place="margin">We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaued by Chriſt.</note> For Chriſt hath already ſaued vs: he hath
perfourmed all things which are required hereunto, that we may be ſaued: he
hath ouercome and ſubdued ſynne, death, hell, &amp;c. ſo that he hath
left nothing, for any man to care for, he hath alſo giuen all theſe things
vnto vs in Baptiſme, that who ſoeuer beleueth in Chriſt, that he hath
perfourmed them, hath them togither in the ſame moment, ſo that he hath
neede of nothing more vnto ſaluation, but faith alone, that he may firmely
beleeue that theſe things are ſo perfourmed. But marke how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable
riches of his grace God hath poured vpon vs in Baptiſme, who hath deliuered
vs euen from thoſe workes, whereby thoſe fooliſh holy ones go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to
merit heauen, and to be ſaued. For we muſt haue heauen, and be ſaued
before we can do any good workes, for that workes can not merit heauen, but
heauen being before giuen of meere grace; cauſeth vs to do good workes, and
that for no hope of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or reward, but onely to the commoditie of our
neighbours, and the glorie of God, vntill this bodie alſo be deliuered from
ſinne and death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What the life of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is after

which they that beleeue in Chriſt do now poſſeſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hidden.
They haue all thinges nowe certainly, but they are yet hid in faith, which when

hypocrites, which contemning faith, do falſely affirme that ſaluation is
farre from thee, and teach thee to endeuour in vaine to attaine vnto it by thy
workes. It is in thy ſelfe, if thou beleeue that all things are perfourmed by
Chriſt, euen as he himſelfe witneſſeth: <hi>The kingdome of God is
within you,</hi> Luke 17. So that all our life after Baptiſme ought to be
nothing els but an expectation, that that ſhould be reuealed which is already
in vs, and that we may comprehend, as we are comprehended, as Paul ſayth
Philip. 3. <hi>I follow, if that I may comprehend that, for whoſe ſake
alſo I am comprehended of Chriſt,</hi> that is, that I may at length ſee
thoſe things which are giuen me, being as yet in the ſhut cloſet of
faith. He coueteth, and burneth with deſire to ſee the treaſure which by
faith he receiued both giuen and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Baptiſme. Whereupon he addeth
in the ſame place: <hi>Our conuerſation is in heauen, from whence alſo we
looke for our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who shall chaunge our vile bodie, that
it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious body.</hi> Herewith alſo agreeth
that which he ſaith Gal. 4: <hi>Ye know God,</hi> and by and by he doth as it
were correct that which he had ſayd, <hi>Yea,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>rather are
ye knowen,</hi> both which are true, although not after the like ſort: We are
now knowen of God, ſo that he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, and we in deede know God,
but we do not yet compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, for that our knowledge is as yet hidden and
cloſed vp in fayth. He ſayth moreouer Rom. 8: <hi>We are ſaued by
hope,</hi> that is, we are ſaued, although we yet ſee it not, for that
which one ſeeth, he hopeth not for, but if we hope for thoſe thinges which
we ſee not, we do with patience abide for them. Chriſt confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this
Luke 12: <hi>Let your loines be gird about, and your lights burning, and ye
your ſelues like vnto men that wait for their maiſter, when he will returne
from the wedding, that when he commeth, and knocketh, they may open vnto him
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly.</hi> In which words he onely biddeth them that be his to be ready
to looke for him the bridegrome, as which are already ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued being admitted
into the number of his miniſters. Hereunto alſo pertaineth that which the
Apoſtle ſayth Tit. 2: <hi>Let vs liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and
godly in this preſent world, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for that bleſſed hope, and
appearing of the glorie of that mightie God, and of our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> In theſe and ſuch like places whereof thou maiſt reade
many here and there in the <pb n="140" facs="tcp:9413:78"/> holy Scriptures, he
witneſſeth that we are already ſaued, and that it doth not behoue, that a
Chriſtian man ſhould firſt ſeeke to attaine to ſaluation by his
workes. This opinion and deueliſh doctrine blyndeth the eyes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
extinguiſheth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of faith, and carieth men from the waye of truth
and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. We muſt cleaue vnto that which the Apoſtle here ſaith:
<hi>He hath ſaued vs according to his mercie,</hi> and that which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

both by doctrine, and alſo by our life which he liueth in vs, may bring them
to the communion of fayth. And albeit he can do this by Angels, yet it
pleaſeth him rather that it ſhould be done by vs men, that both the maner
of fayth may be the better knowen, and that all things may be done ſweetely
and louingly. For if Angels ſhould alwayes haue to do with vs, there ſhould
not be ſo much fayth, neither ſhould it be ſo pleaſaunt, as when we are
taught and guided by them that are partakers of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom we do better
know, and with whom we do more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly aſſociat our ſelues. And ſo,
that there may be ſome, by whom other alſo may be conuerted both by
doctrine, and good examples, it is not meete that we ſhould by and by after
Baptiſme be taken into heauen, wherein notwithſtanding we are already
admitted citizens.</p>

               <note place="margin">A practize of Satan &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Purgatory.</note>Hereupon if one weye all things rightly, it
can not be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is a practize and miracle of Satan and
Antichriſt, that ſo much is ſpent for Purgatories ſake, ſuch faith as
this being put quite out of mens myndes. For men are taught by their workes to
ſaue themſelues from Purgatorie, or at the leaſt to deliuer themſelues
out from thence, as though ſaluation were not yet giuen vs, and it were
neceſſarie to come vnto it by other meanes then by faith alone, which howe
it diſagreeth with the Scripture and a Chriſtian life, there is no man that
doth not ſee, but he that ſeeth nothing in the Scripture. For thus the 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9413:79"/> holy Scriptures do teach euerie where, that who ſoeuer
doth not receiue ſaluation by meere grace, through fayth before all workes,
he ſhall neuer be partaker thereof. And that who ſoeuer referre their good
workes, not to the profite of their neighbours, but to their owne commoditie,
being more carefull of their owne ſaluation then of their neighbours, haue no
good workes at all. All the workes of theſe are voide of fayth, and infected
with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious errour. It had bin greatly to be wiſhed that Purgatorie had
neuer bin inuented, and neuer mention made thereof in the pulpit, for it hath
bin cauſe of ſuch hinderance to Chriſtian veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſyncere truth,
as can not be recouered. For we ſee it now brought to paſſe by the meanes
of Satan, that almoſt al prayers are directed to onely Purgatorie, with this
vngodly and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent opinion, whereby miſerable men thinke that they
ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from thence, and obtaine ſaluation by the workes of men.
Whereby the riches of Baptiſme and fayth are had in no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they
at the laſt of Chriſtians become Heathen. O moſt pernitious abomination.
Chriſtians ſhould be taught as Chriſt and Paul teach them, that after
Baptiſme and abſolution from ſynnes they ſhould ſo liue, that they
ſhould be ready euery houre to receiue death, with deſire looking for the
reuelation of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already receiued. Now by the opinion of Purgatorie
they are made ſecure and ſlothfull, ſo that they differre the ſtudy of
godlines euen to their death, and thinke by contrition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they
ſhall amend all things, as though there were ſome ſynnes remaining for
which they muſt go into Purgatorie, they hope that by Maſſes for the
departed, and other bequeſts that they are perſuaded to make in their
teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or laſt willes, they ſhalbe redeemed out of purgatorie, but
theſe miſerable men are in theſe things vtterly deceiued, and ſhall at

               <hi>By the washing of the new birth.</hi> He ſetteth forth the
grace of God giuen to vs in Baptiſme, with wordes verie full of praiſe and
commendation. He calleth Baptiſme a waſhing, whereby not the feete and
handes, but the whole man is at once waſhed, purified and ſaued, ſo that
to the ſumme and inheritaunce of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation there is neede of nothing but
onely fayth in this grace of God, that it may remaine and be acknowledged the
worke of grace alone, that we are ſaued without all our workes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9413:80"/> and ſo alſo there may remaine in vs pure loue,
praiſe, giuing of thankes, and glorie of the diuine mercie, without all
glorie and pleaſing of our ſelues in our owne ſtrength and endeuour, as
it hath bin already ſayd often and at large. Humane righteouſnes is alſo
a waſhing, but not whereby the whole man is ſo waſhed, but that
Phariſaicall waſhing, whereby onely the apparell and veſſells which are
outward, are made cleane, whereof it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Matth. 23. Whereby it commeth
to paſſe that men ſeeme vnto themſelues pure, but inwardly neuertheles
they remaine ful of filthines.<note place="margin">Baptiſme what maner of
waſhing it is.</note> Therefore he called Baptiſme not a corporall or
out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward waſhing, but the waſhing of regeneration or new birth, by which
not thoſe thinges that are outward, are waſhed, and onely the outward man
made cleane, but the whole nature of man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and changed into an other
nature, that is, the carnall nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie is thereby deſtroyed, with all the

giuen vs at once, ſo that it is not to be gotten by workes. For not one or
two members are wont to be borne, as the handes or feete, but the whole man,
which can not worke this that he may be borne a man, but is firſt borne that
he may worke: Likewiſe our workes do not purifie or ſaue vs, but when as
before we are pure, iuſtified, and ſaued, we worke freely thoſe things,
which may be profit to our neighbour, and honour to God. And this is the
ſimple and pure knowledge of the diuine grace, whereby a man learneth to know
both God and himſelfe: to praiſe God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to humble and caſt downe
himſelfe: to truſt in God, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peire of himſelfe. This doctrine of
ſaluation they maruelouſly hinder, which vrge men with lawes, precepts, and
workes, and teach them to ſeeke thereby to be ſaued.</p>

               <hi>And the renewing.</hi> That this waſhing and new birth
may be more fully vnderſtood, he hath added, <hi>the renewing,</hi> that thou
maieſt vnderſtand, that he that is truly baptized, is become a new man, and
a new creature, endued with a new diſpoſition, which now is farre
otherwiſe affected, loueth, liueth, ſpeaketh and doth farre otherwiſe,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was wont or could before. So the Apoſtle ſayth, Gal. 6: <hi>In
Chriſt neither circumciſion auaileth any thing, nor vncircumciſion,</hi>
that is, no workes of the Lawe are of any value or importaunce, <hi>but a new
creature.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not be perfected by
ioyning togither certaine good <pb n="143" facs="tcp:9413:80"/> workes, but the whole man
muſt be at once renewed, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, whereupon true good workes
will follow of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not by peecemeale, but togither with great
plentie. Of this new birth, whereby the whole man is renewed, Chriſt
ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Ioh. 3: <hi>He that is not borne againe, can not ſee the
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> Here againe it manifeſtly appeareth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is
here done by our workes, but that it behoueth, that man, how great ſoeuer he
be, muſt die, and be chaunged into an other, which is done in Baptiſme, if
we beleeue.<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhalbe borne again, but not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</note> The condemned alſo ſhalbe borne againe in the laſt day,
but they ſhal not be renewed, they ſhall remaine vncleane, as they were
here, and as they were borne of Adam. Therefore that he might ſpeake rightly
of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, he calleth it the waſhing of the new birth, whereby they that
are borne againe are alſo renewed. Of this new birth many things are to be
found here and there in the Scripture, becauſe of which alſo God calleth
his word and Goſpell a wombe and matrix, as Eſai 46: Hearken all ye that
remaine of the houſe of Iſraell, whom I haue borne in my wombe, as mothers
are wont to ſpeake of their children. He therefore that beleeueth the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is as it were conceiued in the wombe of God, &amp; from thence
borne a new man, and like vnto God: Whereof we will in an other place ſpeake
more. Now it ſhalbe ſufficient, to haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by theſe words, how our
workes are nothing in fulfilling the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God, and that it is a
mad thinge to attribute here neuer ſo litle to our owne ſtrength, ſeeing
that it is fayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, whereby man is at once borne againe, &amp; renewed.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnderſtand this, that good workes muſt folow a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but to attaine vnto righteouſnes, &amp; that new creature they are able to
helpe nothing at all.</p>
            <p>No otherwiſe is the grace of God wont to renew man,<note place="margin">How the grace of God reneweth man.</note> then as if God ſhould
turne ſome drie and withered blocke into a new, greene, and floriſhing
tree, which may afterward bringe forth frute plentifully. For the grace of God
is a great, ſtrong, verie mightie, and meruelous effectual thing, it lyeth
not in the minde,<note place="margin">The grace of God excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding effectual and
mighty in operation.</note> as the Schoolemen dreamed: it ſleepeth not, or is
borne, as a painted table beareth a picture: it ſelfe beareth, guideth,
vrgeth, draweth, chaungeth, and worketh all thinges in men, ſo, that euerie
one may feele and haue experience of it. It ſelfe in deede is hyd, but the
workes of it can not be hyd, but do witnes of it, as <pb n="144" facs="tcp:9413:81"/> the
leaues and frutes do of the tree, of what nature it is. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
Scholemen Thomas and Scotus do vngodlily detract from it, who attribute no more
vnto it, then that it doth adorne the workes of nature, and is a helpe that
they be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For it doth not adorne or helpe onely, but it
alone wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thoſe thinges that be good, neither doth it worke them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but doth rather chaunge and renew the perſon. For it exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth the
waſhing of the new birth, and of renewing, not of workes onely, but much
rather of the whole man. He that ſhall preach theſe things of grace,
ſhall truly and fully commend it. Which Paul endeuoured to do when he ſaid:
<hi>He hath ſaued vs by the washing of the new birth, and renewing of the
holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nothing can be done here by ioyning of workes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the
nature muſt needes be chaunged, whereupon it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that they
that truely beleeue muſt ſuffer many thinges: for grace worketh in them,
&amp; declareth it ſelfe preſent. Hereunto pertaineth that ſaying of the
111. Pſal. <hi>The workes of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them
that haue pleaſure therein.</hi> What are theſe workes? We are they, by
grace in Baptiſme made the great, new, and regenerate workes of God. Is it
not a great thinge for a man by and by to be ſaued, and deliuered from
ſynnes, death, and hell? therefore he ſayth: ſought out of all them that
haue pleaſure therein. For by this new birth God hath found out, and done
what ſoeuer men can deſire. For what els do men couet and deſire, but to
obtaine ſaluation, to be deliuered from ſynne, death, and hell?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Laſtly, that he may the more
expreſſe the greatnes and vertue of grace, he attributeth this waſhing of
the new birth, and renewing, to the holy Ghoſt. For this waſhing is ſo
great, and of ſo weightie importaunce, that no creature but the holy Ghoſt
alone is able to perfourme it. But how much, moſt excellent Paul, dooſt
thou condemne free will, the great good workes of the proud holy ones, that is,
the merits of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites? In how hie a place doeſt thou ſet our
ſaluation, and again, how doeſt thou bring it downe to vs, and place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

it is vnpoſſible for a man to be renewed, and the perſon chaunged
(without which no workes acceptable to God <pb n="145" facs="tcp:9413:81"/> can be done)
but by the waſhing of the newe birth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Ghoſt.
That we may plainly ſee in thoſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall counterfaitours of workes.
For thou ſhalt fynde none harder, none prouder, none ſo raſh and haſtie
ſpirits. For they are broken, and not renewed, indurate, obſtinate,
confirmed by continuance, couering in deede and ſome what adorning that old
Adam by thoſe their counterfaite good workes, but in the meane ſeaſon
there doth not any whit appeare any chaunge of nature in them, they continue
ſtill in the oldnes of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fleſh. O, what a peſtilent people
is this, and in how great indignation of God are they, when as in the meane
tyme they thinke that they ſit in Gods lappe?<note place="margin">Waſhing of
the new birth and renewing attributed to the holy Ghoſt.</note> Nowe whereas
the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle attributeth this waſhing of the newe birth, and renewing to
the holy Ghoſt, he ſayth the ſame which Chriſt doth Iohn 3, where he
ſayth: <hi>Except a man be borne againe of water and of the Spirit, he can
not enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> For that which Chriſt ſignified by
water, the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the waſhing, ſo both made mention of newe
birth and of the holy Ghoſt. And we muſt marke that that which is ſpoken
here of the holy Ghoſt both by Chriſt, and the Apoſtle, muſt not be
referred to that Papiſticall confirmation, as they call it, for both of them
referred to Baptiſme that which is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning the holy
Ghoſt, who when the body is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with water, doth himſelfe worke the
newe birth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing by faith, which Chriſt called, to be borne againe
of the ſpirit. We read in the Actes of the Apoſtles, that the Apoſtles
did eftſoones lay their handes on them that were baptiſed, and that ſo
the holy Ghoſt came vpon them by a viſible ſigne, which the Papiſtes
alſo ſnatch to their confirmation. But as that was done, that the beleeuers
might by a viſible ſigne be endued with the holy Ghoſt, to preach the
Goſpell in diuers langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo it continued onely the time thereof,
vntill the doctrine of the Goſpell was commended to the worlde by
ſufficient ſignes, wherefore it is nowe long ſince worne out of vſe:
but that a certaine ceremonie hath come from thence euen vnto vs, of laying
handes on them, which are ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Preachers, which is nowe
brought into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and pernitious vſe: but of theſe thinges in an
other place.</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:9413:82"/>
               <hi>VVhich he shed on vs aboundantly.</hi>
See how notably the Apoſtle ſetteth forth grace. He ſayth not that the
holy Ghoſt was giuen, but ſhed, and not that onely, but ſhed aboundantly.
For he can not ſufficiently extoll and magnifie grace, and the worke thereof,
and we, alas, count it ſo vile in reſpect of our workes.<note place="margin">The workes of the diuine grace ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without any addition of our owne workes.</note> It were a diſhonour to God
and to his holy Spirit, if when he hath plentifully ſhed it vpon vs, there
ſhould as yet be ſome thing wanting, neceſſarie to righteouſnes and
ſaluation, which we are able to perfourme, as though the workes of ſo
incomparable grace could not be ſufficient. And Paul ſurely might be
reproued of lying, which had not ſpoken all thinges whereby we muſt be
iuſtified and ſaued, when he affirmeth that he doth it. But as he writeth,
ſo it is: no man can attribute ſo great thinges to this waſhing and
regeneration, no man can ſo much preſume of them, but greater thinges may
be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto them, and thou oughteſt to promiſe to thy ſelfe moe
thinges of them: no man ſhall beleeue ſo great thinges, but he ſhall
receiue greater. Foraſmuch as thoſe good thinges which God hath giuen, are
ſo great and ſo vnſpeakeable, he would haue them here come vnto vs being
included and hyd in his words and fayth. For the nature of our preſent life
can not beare them being manifeſt, and therefore it muſt periſh, when
they beginne to be reuealed, that man maye by theſe ineſtimable riches,
which he nowe poſſeſſeth by fayth, be as it were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp, and
vaniſh awaye. We are already aboundantly iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by fayth without all
our owne merit, therefore Chriſt ſayth, Ioh. 3: <hi>God ſo loued the
world, that he hath giuen his only begotten Sonne, that who ſoeuer beleeueth
in him, should not perish, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> Behold, they that
beleeue, haue already euerlaſting life, and therefore vndoutedly are
iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and holy without all their owne labour or meanes: that thou
maieſt ſee, that nothing but grace and mercie is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully powred vpon
vs, and that our workes could auaile nothing hereunto.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt perhaps ſay: Thou canſt not preach ſufficiently,
that the grace and mercie of God doth worke all things in vs,<note place="margin">An obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and that no reſpect is to be had of our

haue wrought <pb n="147" facs="tcp:9413:82"/> good workes? As Iohn. 5: <hi>They shall come
forth, that haue done good, vnto the reſurrection of life, but they that haue
done euell vnto the reſurrection of condemnation.</hi> And Rom. 2: <hi>Honour
and glorie to them that do well, wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that do
ill.</hi> We read many ſentences here and there in the Scripture like vnto
theſe. I aunſwere:<note place="margin">The anſwere.</note> As the wordes
ſound, ſo take them without all gloſſe, for it is euen ſo, they that
do well ſhalbe ſaued, they which do otherwiſe, ſhalbe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But
herein many erre from the truth of the Scripture, in that they iudge workes
according the outward appearance,<note place="margin">Works muſt not be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the outward appearance.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Scripture,
which teacheth that no man can do good, whoe is not himſelfe good before, and
by workes no man can become good, but workes take their goodnes of the worker,
and he becommeth good by the waſhing of the new birth, and by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els.
This Chriſt meant Matth. 7. ſayng: <hi>A corrupt tree can not bring forth
good frute, neither a good tree euell frute.</hi> Wherefore make the tree
either good or euell, and it will bring forth like frutes. Hypocrites
oftentimes do workes like to the workes of the Godly, yea ſometime hauing a
goodlier ſhewe, for they diligently praye, faſt, giue almes, and pretend a
mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous holines, but Chriſt calleth theſe ſheepes clothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
moſt hurtfull wolues are clothed and hidden. For none of them is of a true
humble, meeke, and bountifull heart, which they chiefely declare when they are
rebuked, when their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is reproued: for then bring they forth their
naturall frutes, whereby they are knowen. Thoſe are, raſhe iudgementes,
impatiencie, ſtubburnnes, obſtinacie, ſclaundering, and ſuch like. It
is true therefore, he that doth well, ſhalbe ſaued, that is, his
ſaluation ſhalbe manifeſt, but he can doe no good at all, if he be not
before regenerate by the waſhing of the newe birth. For what good workes can
one worke in the oldenes of the fleſhe, and by the ſtrength proceeded from
Adam, they are the good workes which Paule here condemneth, ſaying: <hi>Not
by the workes of righteouſnes which we had done.</hi> They are in deede good
workes done in righteouſnes, but not before God, who firſt hath reſpect
to the perſon, &amp; then to the workes, as we read Gen. 4. that he had
reſpect firſt to Abel, then to his ſacrifice, as he firſt turneth
himſelfe from Cain, and then from his ſacrifice, although according to the
outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce <pb n="148" facs="tcp:9413:83"/> it was as good a ſacrifice and
worke, as the ſacrifice of Abel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour.</hi> This he added that
he may keepe vs vnder the winges of Chriſt, as chickens are wont to be
preſerued vnder the winges of the hen: for thus Chriſt ſayth Matth. 23:
<hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, how often would I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children
togither, as the hen gathereth her chickens vnder her winges, and ye would
not?</hi> And hereby the nature of a true and right faith is taught. For it is
nothing which ſome ſay: I beleeue in God almightie, as the Iewes and many
other are wont, and do therefore receiue corporall benefites of God. It is a
true and liuely faith,<note place="margin">What a true &amp; liuely faith
beleeueth.</note> whereby thou beleeueſt in God, howbeit by Ieſus Chriſt.
Firſt that thou dout not that God is become a merciful father vnto thee,
which hath pardoned all thy ſinnes, &amp; in Baptiſme hath adopted thee for
his ſonne and heire, that thou maieſt certainly know that thou art ſaued.
Againe, thou muſt alſo knowe this, that that was not done freely, neither
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatiſfaction made to the diuine iuſtice. For there can be no
place in thee for the diuine grace and mercy to worke ſaluation, and to giue
thee eternall good thinges, vnleſſe the iuſtice of God be before moſt
fully ſatiſfied. For Chriſt witneſſeth Matth. 5: <hi>One iote, or one
title of the Lawe shall not ſcape, till all thinges be fulfilled.</hi> That
which is ſpoken of the grace and goodnes of God, can not come but to them
which do moſt purely and exactly obſerue his commaundements, according to
that ſaying Mich. 2: When as the Iewes did preſume of the goodnes of God
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and did alwayes promiſe vnto them ſelues peace, ſaying: How
can God be alwayes angrie, is the ſpirit of the Lord ſhortened? It is
aunſwered them: Are not my wordes good vnto him that walketh vprightly?
Wherefore it ſhalbe lawfull for none to attaine vnto the aboundance of grace,
vnles he hath before moſt exactly ſatiſfied the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of
God.<note place="margin">Though we coulde and ſhould fulfill the
commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of God, yet ſhould we merit nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of him.</note> Now it
hath bin ſpoken at large, that our workes are nothing before God, whereby we
can not fulfill ſo much as the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, how much
leſſe ſhall we be able ſo to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie the iuſtice of God, that
we may become worthie of his grace? Moreouer, if we were able to fulfill all
the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and in all thinges to ſatiſfie his iuſtice,
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we had not as yet deſerued grace and ſaluation, neither 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9413:83"/> ſhould he therefore owe it vnto vs, for that he may by
the right of creation require as due ſeruice, all thoſe things of vs his
crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, created to liue vnto him. Wherefore it ſhould yet come of grace
and mercie, what ſoeuer ſhould come from him to vs. This Chriſt declared
verie well Luke 17. ſpeaking in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>VVhich of you hauing a
ſeruaunt plowing or feeding cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, would ſaye vnto him by and by, when
he were come from the field: Go, and ſit downe at the table? and would not
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay to him, dreſſe wherewith I may ſuppe, and girde thy
ſelfe, and ſerue me, till I haue eaten and dronken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eat thou
and drinke thou? Doeth he thanke that ſeruaunt, becauſe he did that which
was commaunded vnto him? I trowe not. So likewiſe ye, when ye haue done all
thoſe things which are commaunded you, ſay, VVe are vnprofitable
ſeruaunts: we haue done that which was our dutie to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seing then that heauen is giuen of grace, and for no merit, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto thoſe, if there were any ſuch, which haue done all things that were
commaunded them, according to that promiſe: <hi>If thou wilt enter into life,
keepe the commaundements:</hi> what ſhall we boaſt of our good workes,
which although they were moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, yet ſhould they be vnworthie of
heauen, but inaſmuch as it is giuen vs by the free and mercifull
promiſe?<note place="margin">We had need of one who ſhould ſatisfie the
diuine iuſtice for vs.</note> Hereupon (for that we muſt ſo ſatiſfie
the diuine iuſtice, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our workes are not able to
attaine thereunto, whereunto if they ſhould attaine, yet ſhould they
deſerue no grace or ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that they are before due) God firſt
gaue vnto vs a man, which ſhould ſatiſfie the diuine iuſtice for vs in
all thinges. Againe, he hath by the ſame man beſtowed this grace and
bountifulnes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, that albeit we without our owne merit and
worthines,<note place="margin">Not by our owen merit, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of
Chriſt are we ſaued.</note> yea hauing euel deſerued and being vnworthie,
do receiue grace, yet it commeth not vnto vs altogither freely and without all
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for we haue it through the merit and ſatiſfaction of Chriſt.
Whereupon Paul ſayth Rom. 5: <hi>As by the offence of one ſinne came on all
men to condemnation: ſo by the iuſtifying of one,</hi> that is, of Ieſus
Chriſt, <hi>the benefite abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded toward all men to the iuſtification of
life.</hi> That is: As without all our merit, and owne worke we fell into
ſynne, being borne ſynners, ſo againe without all our merit and meanes,
we are redeemed from ſinnes, by the waſhing of the ſpirit borne againe
the ſonnes of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers <pb n="150" facs="tcp:9413:84"/> of grace and ſaluation.
And this is the cauſe why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle where he ſpeaketh of faith and
grace, is wont to adde, by Ieſus Chriſt: whereby ſurely he would giue vs
to vnderſtand, that none ſhould count it ſufficient, if he ſay: I
beleeue in God, Chriſt being neglected. He that truly beleeueth, muſt
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that his faith can not be acceptable to God, yea that it can be
no faith at all, if all the commaundements of God be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fulfilled,
which ſeeing it is aboue thy abilitie, (and if it were not, yet
notwithſtanding thou hadſt perfourmed nothing, but that thou oughteſt,
and hadſt as yet merited nothing, hauing ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled euen all the
commaundements of God) thou haſt neede of an other, which in all thinges may
ſatiſfie the diuine iuſtice for thee, and may alſo merit heauen for
thee. Now this other is our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who hath for
thee fulfilled the whole Lawe, and merited for thee, that God now according to
his iuſtice can not but giue heauen vnto thee, and in all thinges acknowledge
thee for his ſonne and heire. And this is a true and ſound faith, which
truſteth in God by Chriſt, and is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that by his merit it hath
already receiued of God ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhortly after ſhalbe reuealed
with bleſſed aboundance of felicitie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtian faith.</note>Neither can any other
be called Chriſtian faith, but that, whereby it is beleeued, that by Chriſt
do come vnto vs both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction, which we owe to the iuſtice of God,
and the gift of ſaluation, which we our ſelues by no meanes, if the Lawe
could euen be fulfilled of vs, can merit. Whereupon Paul Rom. 4. ſayth:<note place="margin">We haue all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by any
merit of our owen, but by the merit and meanes of Ieſus Chriſt.</note>
               <hi>Chriſt was deliuered to death for our ſynnes, and roſe againe for our
iuſtification.</hi> That is, by Chriſt we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not onely
remiſſion of ſynnes, but moreouer alſo, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God we are
accounted righteous, &amp; the ſonnes of his grace. To the ſame effect
alſo tendeth that which he ſayth Rom. 3: <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to
be a reconciliation through faith in his blood.</hi> Where againe we learne,
that it is true faith, which truſteth in the blood of Chriſt, and beleeueth
that thereby it ſhall obtaine grace. Whereas thou beleeueſt that he hath
ſhed his blood for thee, thou receiueſt ſatiſfaction: in that thou
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt him the reconciliation, thou confeſſeſt that by his
merit the diuine grace and ſaluation do come vnto thee. We haue all things
without our owne merit and meanes, but not without the <pb n="151" facs="tcp:9413:84"/>
merit and meanes of Chriſt, who hath for this cauſe ſhed his blood.
Wherefore that we may allude vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parable of Chriſt, we muſt containe
our ſelues vnder his winges, and not vpon truſt in our ſelues flie out,
and contend to come vnto God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhalbe a praye to the helliſh
kite. For as it hath bin ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayd, our righteouſnes, our merits, yea and
our faith ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile nothing, without this our mediatour Chriſt. And
therefore he ſayth Ioh. 14: <hi>No man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto the Father, but by
me.</hi> And in the whole Goſpell what other thing doth he, but ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to
take vs out of our ſelues, and to tranſferre vs to himſelfe vnder his
winges, that we may truſt onely in his ſatiſfaction and merit? The ſame
the Apoſtle alſo teacheth in the wordes following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we being iuſtified by his grace, should be made heires
according to the hope of eternall life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">We are
iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the grace of Chriſt Ieſus.</note> He ſayth that we are
iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied, not by our owne workes, but by the grace of the ſame Ieſus
Chriſt. That is, we are therefore iuſtified, for that Chriſt hath the
grace of the Father, hauing fulfilled his will in all thinges, and thereby
merited eternall life. For ſeeing that he hath no neede of this merit, he
giueth it vnto vs which beleeue in him, that before God all his thinges may be
imputed to vs, and by them we may receiue ſaluation. See, how rich a thing
ſound faith is, and how great good things it bringeth with it. See alſo how
precious a thing the Goſpell is, and how great a treaſure it is to haue it
purely preached: and contrariwiſe, how great a diſcommoditie there is,
where it is not preached, or not rightly preached, the inuentions of men being
mingled with it, or thruſt in ſtede of it. Take heede therefore of ſuch
deceiuers, and of their counterfet faith, reſt not in thy ſelfe, but get
thee vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winges of Chriſt, keepe thy ſelfe vnder his protection,
truſt that thou art heire of eternall life, not by thy owne righteouſnes,
or grace which thou haſt receiued, but whereby he is righteous and
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God. Hereunto pertaineth this ſaying Pſal. 91. <hi>He
will couer thee vnder his winges, and thou shalt be ſafe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his
fethers.</hi> And in the Songe of Salomon it is ſaid: <hi>My ſpouſe is a
doue, building her neaſt in the caues of the rockes, and in the holes of the
wall,</hi> that is, in the woundes of Chriſt. And this in deede is a true
Chriſtian faith, which reſteth not in it ſelfe as the Scholemen dreamed,
but repoſeth it ſelfe wholy in <pb n="152" facs="tcp:9413:85"/> Chriſt, and as it
truſteth in him, ſo it reſteth in him, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued eternall
ſaluation. Whereas he ſaith that we are made heires of eternall life
according to hope, beſide that he proueth, that we without all our owne
merits, by onely hope of grace are borne againe heires of eternall life, and do
not become heires by working, whereof we haue already ſpoken at large, he
alſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth this, that our ſaluation and eternall life is as yet hid,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, if we beleeue, we do verely poſſeſſe it, and this body being
put of, and the kingdome of Chriſt reuealed, all thinges ſhall appeare
manifeſtly.</p>

            <head>A SERMON OF D. MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIN LVTHER OF THE KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM OF GOD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as there is often mention made in the new Teſtament
of theſe wordes, the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the kingdom of God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of
Chriſt, and it is very profitable and expedient for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to know
theſe, to wit, that they are nothing els, but remiſſion of ſinnes, and
grace preached and offered by the Goſpell. For in this kingdom thou ſhalt
finde nothing but grace and goodnes, pardon and forgiuenes of ſinnes, loue
and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: I therefore thinke it good to entreate ſomewhat at large of
the ſtate of this kingdom, and of forgiuenes of ſinnes. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
God, whereby he reigneth ouer all the faithfull, and as a faithfull king
defendeth, puniſheth, rewardeth, guideth, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth them, &amp;c. they
againe from their hart truſt in him, ſuffer his fatherly chaſtiſement
and correction with a patient mind, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſerue him through obedience,
is not worldly or temporal, but ſpiritual. Neither conſiſteth it in meate
and drinke,<note place="margin">The kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in it
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> or in any outward thing, but onely in iuſtification,
quieting and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hart and conſcience of man. Wherfore it is
nothing els, but forgiuenes and taking away of ſinnes, by which conſciences
are defiled, troubled, and diſquieted.<note place="margin">A
ſimilitude.</note> For euen as a worldly and temporall kingdom is ordayned to
this ende, that men may liue quietly &amp; peaceably one with an other: So the
kingdom of God giueth theſe thinges ſpiritually, and deſtroyeth the
kingdom of ſinne, and is nothing elſe, but an aboliſhing and pardoning of
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. God reigneth in the hartes, inaſmuch as he worketh in them by his
word, peace quietnes and conſolation: euen as ſinne worketh the contrary,
namely, vnquietnes, anguiſh, and all kinde of euills. Herein God ſheweth
his maieſtie and grace in this life, that he taketh away and pardoneth mens
ſinnes: and this is the kingdome of grace. Nowe when as ſinne with his
gard, that is Satan, death, and hell, ſhall trouble man no more, then at the
laſt <pb n="154" facs="tcp:9413:86"/> the kingdom of glory, and abſolute felicitie
ſhall be.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God is gouerned, not by the law,
but by the Goſpell.</note>Hereupon it followeth: firſt, that the kingdom of
God is ruled or gouerned by no law, no not by the law of God, much leſſe by
the lawes of men, but onely by the Goſpell, and faith in God, by which harts
are purified, comforted, and quieted, whiles that the holy Ghoſt poureth loue
and the knowledge of God into them, &amp; maketh man as it were one thinge and
one ſpirit with God: ſo that his affection is ſet vpon the ſame thinge,
he willeth and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſame thinge, he ſeeketh and loueth the
ſame thinge, that God doth. Neither ſtandeth the caſe otherwiſe here,
then it doth betweene two frendes, which beare good wil one to an other, and
agree one with an other in all thinges. Hereof it commeth, that a man in this
kingdome of God is perfect, mercifull, pitifull and bountifull toward his
neighbour, ſeeing that he knoweth by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, that
God is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame affection toward him, and toward all men, and doth poure
forth his goodnes plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully. Such affection of God no man can know by the
lawe, but onely by the ſpirit, and word of the Goſpell. None therefore
ſhal obtaine quietnes, comfort, and peace of the hart, or attaine vnto the
kingdom of God by any law. And they which preſcribe many lawes, doe withdraw
men from the kingdom of God, to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſinne, wherein is nothing
els, but vnquietnes, anguiſh, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, aduerſitie, and all kind of
euills tormenting the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Like as on the contrary, in the kingdom
and knowledge of God, there is meere ioy, peace, and conſolation of
harts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How Chriſt reigneth in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
God.</note>Secondly: In this kingdom of God the Lord Chriſt reigneth no
otherwiſe, then as a Maiſter of an Hoſpitall among the ſicke, poore,
and diſeaſed. For vnto this kingdome none pertaine, but ſinnefull and
miſerable men, vnto whome their ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Hereupon Chriſt
ſayth in the Goſpell Luke <hi>6: VVo be to you that are riche, which haue
receiued your conſolation.</hi> But contrariwiſe, the poore, miſerable,
and ſuccourles receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ioy by the Goſpel: for Chriſt came to
call ſinners onely, and not the righteous, that all glory may be referred to
God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,<note place="margin">Chriſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away ſinne after two
ſortes.</note> for that he forgiueth ſinnes of his grace and meere mercy.
Such aboliſhing or putting away of ſinne, wherein Chriſt reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as
King of the kingdome of God, is done of him after two ſortes: firſt thus,
in that he remitteth, pardoneth and couereth ſinnes, ſo that God will not
regard, remember or reuenge them <pb n="155" facs="tcp:9413:86"/> although they be in a
man. As it is in the <hi>32</hi> Pſalme: <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe
iniquities are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Bleſſed is the
man to whom the Lord wil not impute ſinne, in whoſe ſpirit there is no
guile.</hi> And in Eſay cap. <hi>43</hi> God ſayth: <hi>I am, euen I am he,
that for myne owne ſelfs ſake do away thine offences, and forget thy
ſinnes, ſo that I vvill neuer thinke vpon them.</hi> Secondely thus, in
that he purgeth or rather ſcoureth ſinnes by diuers croſſes and
afflictions. For they are two things, to remit ſinnes, and to weaken the body
of ſinne that it may not reigne in vs. If a man beleeue, and is baptized,
then all his ſinnes are forgiuen him. But afterwarde ſinne muſt be
ſcoured or aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by manifold affliction and mortification, as long as he
ſhall liue. Sinne ſticketh in vs, as long as the mortal body remaineth, but
for Chriſtes ſake it is not imputed in the wrath of God, but freely
remitted,<note place="margin">True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note>
and the force thereof diminiſhed by his fatherly chaſtiſement. In ſuch
chaſtiſement for their amendement, true Chriſtians haue had great
comfort, peace, and ioye, as Paule ſayth Rom. <hi>5: Then being iuſtified
by faith, vve haue peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by
vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo through faith, vve haue had this acceſſe into this grace,
wherin we ſtand, and reioyce vnder the hope of the glory of God. Neither that
onely, but alſo vve reioyce in tribulations, knovving that tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
bringeth forth patience, and patience experience, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hope. And
hope maketh not ashamed, becauſe the loue of God is shed abroad in our harts
by the holy Ghoſt vvhich is giuen vnto vs.</hi> So thou haſt two thinges to
be conſidered: The firſt, that in this kingdom of God we are iuſtified.
The ſeconde, that by tribulation and affliction we are glorified, without
which we can not attaine vnto glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, good Chriſtians are not knowen by this, when any
ſuffer manifold tribulation &amp; chaſtiſement, that the body of ſinne
may be weakened, and they brought to amendement. For herein they doe altogither
differ amonge them ſelues, one ſuffereth this, an other that: one is
chaſtiſed thus, an other otherwiſe, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they very Apoſtles
did not loue and ſuffer alike: But they are knowen in forgiuenes of ſinnes,
or iuſtification by faith, wherein God turneth his anger from them, &amp;
receiueth them vnto grace, and counteth them for his deare children, and
imputeth no ſinne to them vnto condemnation. Herein are all alike, euen as
all <pb n="156" facs="tcp:9413:87"/> liue vnder one heauen. Wherefore they doe moſt
groſſely erre &amp; ſtumble, which meaſure Chriſtians by maners,
workes, and the outwarde maner of liuing, euen as the Phariſees were wont to
doe, and did therefore finde fault with Chriſt, for that he did not obſerue
their ceremonies, but was a frend of Publicanes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. As that
Phariſe ſayd within him ſelfe Luke <hi>7: If this man were a Prophet, he
would ſurely haue knowne who, and vvhat maner of vvoman this is, vvhich
toucheth him: for she is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A
ſimilitude</note> Heare nowe an example of thoſe thinges which are before
ſayd: A Phiſitian which goeth about to cure the ſicke, doth firſt
promiſe him health by the aſſiſtance and helpe of God, whereby he
putteth him in great hope and comfort. Afterward he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to purge, to
clenſe and ſtrengthen, and ſuch like thinges, which make to the
recouering of health: So God alſo, when he hath remitted ſinnes, and
receiued man into the boſom of grace, doth lay on him all kind of
afflictions, and doth ſcoure him, and renue him from day to day, in the
knowledge and loue of God, vntil he become ſafe, pure and renued, which then
at the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, when this mortall body dyeth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly in theſe two partitions of the kingdom of God, two
ſortes of men are founde,<note place="margin">Two ſortes of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the
kingdom of grace.</note> which abuſe the ſame kingdome of the grace of God,
and the Goſpell. Some become ſluggiſh and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſaying: Well,
if ſinnes be pardoned freely of meere grace, and be waſhed away in
baptiſme, there is no neede that I ſhould adde any thinge of mine owne.
Other thinke contrariwiſe, that they ſhal put away their ſinnes by works,
and ſo truſting to their owne merits, they are proud and arrogant, and in
reſpect of them ſelues contemne other, which doe not ſo. The firſt of
theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne Gods grace: the other oppugne it, as not ſufficient, and
ſo they repreſent ſwine and dogges. Now all this appeareth by the
Goſpell, by which Chriſt reigneth in the kingdom of God. For ſome abuſe
it vnto carnall libertie: other contrariwiſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it is not
ſufficient to ſaluation, but that their workes alſo doe helpe ſomewhat,
and by this they deny and contemne the grace of God. Hereof thou mayſt read
more in the Epiſtle to the Romanes, wherein theſe two ſortes of men are
plainly ſet forth.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, this kingdom of God, or remiſſion of ſinnes hath no
bounde or meaſure,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.21.22.</note> as that
place of the Goſpell doth very well ſhew, where Peter aſketh the Lord:
<hi>Lord, how oft shal my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="157" facs="tcp:9413:87"/> ſinne againſt me,
and I shall forgiue him? vnto ſeuen times? Ieſus ſayd vnto him, I ſay
not to thee, vnto ſeuen times, but vnto ſeuenty times ſeuen times,</hi>
that is, as often as ſhall be needefull. After this followeth a parable,<note place="margin">We muſt forgiue our neighbour, if we will haue God to forgiue
vs.</note> which the Lorde there putteth forth, wherein he moſt ſeuerely
admoniſheth vs, if we will not fal out of the fauour of God, that we forgiue
our neighbour his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences without all delay or grudging. Foraſmuch as God
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes forgiueth vs innumerable ſinnes. Our dette, whereby we are bound
vnto God, is ten thouſand talents, that is, ſo vnmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and great,
that we are not able to pay it with all our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, all our ſtrength
and workes. For we can put away no one ſinne, although it be euen very litle.
Seeing therefore that God doth remit ſo many ſinnes of his grace in his
kingdome, it is meete, that we ſhould forgiue our neighbour a few offences.
Of this kingdom of God, wherein ſinnes are forgiuen, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euery
where maketh mention, and ſayth, that the kingdom &amp; dominion of Chriſt
doth extend from one ende of the lande to the other. So ſayth Dauid Pſal.
<hi>72: His dominion shall be from the one ſea to the other, and from the
fludde vnto the ende of the earth.</hi> And a litle after he ſayth: <hi>All
nations shall ſerue him.</hi> This alſo the Angell Gabriell declared to the
Virgine Marie Luke <hi>1.</hi> where he ſayth thus of Chriſt: <hi>The Lord
shall giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the throne of his father Dauid, and he shall reigne ouer
the houſe of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdom shall be no end.</hi> Theſe
and ſuch like places do ſhew that the forgiuenes of ſinnes, wherin the
kingdom of God doth eſpecially conſiſt, hath no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or bound.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, hereof we may ſee, how vnchriſtianly they doe,<note place="margin">An vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian thinge to preſcribe a meaſure to forgiuenes

meaſure, as they doe, which meaſure out their indulgences for preſcribed
yeares, with forgiuenes of the third, fourth, or halfe part. For hereby they
bringe the kingdom of God into a narrow and ſtraite roome, and are iniurious
to his mercy, foraſmuch as there is no ende of his kingdom, nor meaſure of
his mercy. But whoſoeuer ſhal in faith call vpon the name of God, ſhall
be ſaued, as often as he doth it. Moreouer, when the ſinner ſhall be
ſory for his ſinnes, the Lorde will no more remember them, as it is in the

            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, as this kingdome of God hath no meaſure or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9413:88"/> of forgiuenes of ſinnes, ſo alſo it hath no ende,
but endureth continually without ceaſſing: albeit the ſubiects of this
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doe not abide in it continually, firmely and faithfully, but do often
times forſake it. So the fauour and grace of God were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with
Peter, although he denied the Lorde, and reuolted from him. To the ſame
effect tendeth the parable in the Goſpell whereof we haue now ſpoken. For
the ſeruaunt, which would not haue pitie of his felow ſeruaunt, did make
him ſelfe vnworthy of the mercy of God, did depriue him ſelfe of the
kingdom of God, which conſiſteth in pardoning of offences, as it is aboue
mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Here Vniuerſitie Diuines of a pregnant wit, as they ſeeme vnto
them ſelues, and puffed vp with knowledge, haue diſputed, whether, and how
forgiuenes of ſinnes doth come againe, when man iterateth or renueth his
ſinne, not knowing what they ſay. But follow thou the plaine and ſimple
wordes of the Goſpell, to wit, that thy ſinnes are ſo often forgiuen
thee, as thou dooſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue thy brother, whom thou muſt ſo often forgiue
as he ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt thee.<note place="margin">We muſt for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giue our
bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren when they offend againſt vs.</note> Wherefore in this parable,
whereof I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now made mention, Chriſt doth admoniſh vs all, that we
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiue all them that haue offended vs. As if he would ſay: As in
mans affayres, he which is beneficial to an other, hath other alſo
beneficiall vnto him againe, ſo ſayth Chriſt, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen,
which conſiſteth ſpecially in forgiuenes of ſinnes, that is in
Chriſtianity or among Chriſtians, he which pardoneth an other his offences,
I alſo will pardon him his. And on the contrary, he that is not mercifull
toward an other, to him I alſo will deny grace. I am ouer you as Lord and
King, and ye are fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeruaunts and companions one with an other. Seeing
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I your Lorde doe readily forgiue you, you alſo ought more
readily to forgiue one an other. After the ſame ſort alſo he hath
commaunded vs to pray in the Lords prayer, Matth. 6: <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our
dettes:</hi> which he would not haue done, if he did not promiſe and would
not mercifully forgiue vs. But neuertheles he added a condition or ſigne to
this promiſe, when he ſayth: <hi>If ye forgiue men their treſpaſſes,
your heauenly Father will alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue you.</hi> The firſt is a ſigne,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other a promiſe. Marke that it is here enioyned vs, to forgiue one an
other his ſinnes and offences, ſo, that we muſt be mercifull and
bountifull towarde our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if we will haue the heauenly father gentle
and appeaſed <pb n="159" facs="tcp:9413:88"/> toward vs. And let vs be moſt certainly
perſwaded hereof, when we ſhall interpret at the beſt, and excuſe, as
much as equitie doth ſuffer, the offences and treſpaſſes of other,
although they be euen great and grieuous, that we alſo ſhall haue a
bountifull and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull father toward vs in heauen.<note place="margin">A
moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian thing not to forgiue our brethren, but to beare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in our hart &amp; ſeeke to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> Wherefore it is a thinge
moſt abhorring from Chriſtianitie, and euen blaſphemous, when it is
ſayd: I can not, neither will I forgiue him that which he hath committed
againſt me, I wil be reuenged, &amp;c. Surely thoſe blind me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ignorant,
that they doe take from God his glory, to whom alone vengeance belongeth, and
chalenge it to them ſelues, and ſo they giue vp to the deuill their owne
ſoules, which they haue receiued of God, &amp; ought to render them vnto him
againe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are perhaps prouoked euen with ſome ſmall or
trifle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling matter. Such kind of men as theſe ought to ſette before the
eyes of their hart, theſe wordes of the Goſpell, Matth. 18: <hi>O e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
ſeruant, I forgaue thee all that dette, becauſe thou prayedſt me:
oughteſt not thou alſo to haue had pitie on thy fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, euen as
I had pitie on thee? So his Lord was wrath, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him to the
tormentors, til he should pay all that was due to him: So likevviſe shall
mine heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye forgiue from your ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> eche one to his brother their
treſpaſſes.</hi> Neither is it ſufficient, if in geſtures, ſignes,
mouth or tongue thou ſhew thy ſelfe a frend vnto him, and forgiue him, but
thou muſt doe it from thy hart, otherwiſe God will not forgiue thee, yea
thou ſhalt be driuen out of the kingdom of grace. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if at any tyme we
haue tryed the mercy of God towarde vs, we muſt alſo readily pardon our
felow brethren, which haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended vs. For in that reſpect the mercifull
Father forgiueth vs our ſinnes, that we alſo ſhould forgiue our brethren,
&amp; ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy toward them, euen as he is merciful toward vs, and
remitteth ſinne, death, the fault and the puniſhment. When we ſhal do
this, then are we receiued into the kingdom of God. For the goodnes of God
liueth in our hartes, and maketh vs alſo good. Chriſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the
right hand of the Father, yet neuertheles he reigneth in the hartes and

diligently obey him, no otherwiſe then obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſubiects doe their King,
and in all their doinges are made like to him, euen as he him ſelfe ſayth,
Matth. 5: <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father vvhich is in heauen, is
perfect.</hi> Now God is perfect <pb n="160" facs="tcp:9413:89"/> in this, that he taketh

            <p>

one,<note place="margin">The promiſe of God is firſt to be conſidered of in

cheerefull to pray: for vnles God had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to pray, and had
promiſed alſo that he will heare vs, euen all creatures could not obtayne
ſo much as a grayne by their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Whereupon it followeth, that no man
doth obtayne any thinge of God for his owne worthines, or the worthines of his
prayer, but by the onely goodnes of God, who preuenting all our petitions and
deſires, prouoketh vs to pray and deſire of him, by his gentle and
bounteous promiſe and commaundement, that we may learne howe great care he
hath ouer vs, and is ready to giue vs moe thinges, then we durſt enterpriſe
to aſke, and that we may alſo learne to pray boldely, inaſmuch as he
giueth vs all thinges euen in more ample maner then we doe aſke them.<note place="margin">We muſt no thing doute of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God in

of the true and faythfull God, for therefore he hath promiſed that he will
heare vs, yea and hath commaunded vs to pray, that we might haue a ſure and
ſtronge fayth, that our prayer ſhall be ſo heard, as he ſayth Matth.
21. and Marke 11: <hi>VVhatſoeuer ye shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye
shall receyue it.</hi> And in Luke chapt. 11: <hi>And I ſay vnto you, Aske,
and it shall be giuen you: ſeeke, and ye shall finde: knocke, and it shall be
opened vnto you. For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that ſeeketh,
findeth: and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a ſonne shall aske
bread of any of you that is a father, will ye giue him a ſtone? or if he aske
a fish, will ye for a fish, giue him a ſerpent? or if he aske an egge, will
ye giue him a ſcorpion? If ye then vvhich are euill, can giue good giftes
vnto your children, how <pb n="162" facs="tcp:9413:90"/> much more shall your heauenly
Father giue the holy Ghoſt to them that deſire him?</hi> We muſt boldly
truſt to theſe, and ſuch like promiſes and commaundements, and pray
with true confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">He that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the promiſes of God in
prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a double ſinne.</note>If one ſo prayeth, that he dout
whether God heare him, and maketh his prayer onely at aduenture, caring not
greatly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be hearde or not hearde: he committeth a double offence:
One, for that he him ſelfe maketh his praier fruſtrate, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in
vaine. For ſo Iames ſayth chap. 1: <hi>He that vvill aske of the Lord let
him aske in faith, and vvauer not: for he that vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, is like a vvaue of
the ſea, toſt of the vvinde, and caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay, let not that man thinke
that he shall receiue any thinge of the Lord.</hi> Such a mans hart is not
quiet &amp; ſetled, wherefore God can giue him nothing. But faith maketh the
hart quiet, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the gifts of God. The other offence is, that he
counteth the moſt faithfull and true God, as a lying, vaine, and vnconſtant
man, as he which neither is able, neither will fulfill his promiſes, ſo by
his douting he robbeth God of his honour, &amp; name of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, and
truth. Whereby it is ſo grieuouſly offended, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that offence being
committed, a Chriſtian is plainly chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into an Heathen, and denieth and
loſeth his true God, ſo that if he continue therein, he is damned for euer
without all comfort. And if any thing be giuen vnto him, which he aſketh, it
is giuen him not to good, but to euill, as well temporall as eternall, not for
his prayers ſake, but from the wrath of God, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe
thoſe goodly wordes, which are vttered in ſinnes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, and to the
diſhonour of God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">We muſt not therefore dout in our prayers for
that we be vnworthy.</note>Some ſay: I would truſt in deede that my prayers
ſhould be heard, if I were worthy, or if I could pray well. Then, ſay I, if
thou wilt not pray, before thou ſhalt knowe and finde thy ſelfe fit to
pray, that thou ſhalt neuer pray. For as it is before ſayde, our prayer
muſt not reſt vpon our worthines, or the worthines of it ſelfe, or be
grounded thereon, but vpon the immutable truth of the promiſe of God. If ſo
be that it truſt to it ſelfe or any other thing, and ground it ſelfe
thereon, it is falſe, and deceiueth thee, albeit thy hart ſhould euen be
burſt by reaſon of the ardent affection of godlines, and thou ſhouldeſt
weepe nothing but dropps of blood. For therefore we pray, becauſe we are
vnworthy to pray, and hereby ſurely we are made worthy to pray, and fit to be
heard, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:9413:90"/> inaſmuch as we thinke that we are vnworthy,<note place="margin">How we are made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be heard in prayer.</note> and doe
boldly and cheerefully truſt to the faithfulnes and truth of God. Although
thou be vnworthy, yet haue regard hereunto, and marke moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, that
a thouſand times more conſiſteth in this, that thou honour the truth of
God, and not with thy doutfulnes accuſe his faithfull promiſe of
falſhood. For thy owne worthines doth not further thee, neither thy
vnworthines hinder thee: but infidelitie doth condemne thee, truſt and
confidence maketh thee worthy &amp; preſerueth thee. Wherefore ſo behaue
thy ſelfe all thy life long, that thou doe not at any time eſteeme thy
ſelfe either worthy or fit to pray or receiue, vnles thou finde thy ſelfe
to be ſuch a one, as dareth enterpriſe the matter freely, truſting to the
true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine promiſe of thy mercifull God, which will ſo ſhewe both
his mercy and goodnes vnto thee, that as he promiſed to heare thee being
vnworthy, and hauing not deſerued it, of his meere grace, moued with no
prayers: ſo he will heare thee being an vnworthy aſker, of his onely grace,
to the honour of his truth and promiſe, that ſo thou mayſt giue thankes,
not to thy owne worthines, but to his truth, wherby he hath fulfilled his
promiſe, and to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby he hath made and ſet forth his
promiſe. And this the 25 Pſalme confirmeth, where Dauid ſayth:
<hi>Gracious and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is the Lord, therefore vvill he teach ſinners in
the vvay. He vvill guide the meeke in iudgement, and teach the humble his vvay.
All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth, vnto ſuch as keepe his
couenaunt, and his teſtimonies.</hi> Grace and mercy are in his promiſe,
faithfulnes or truth in fulfilling and hearing. And in the 85 Pſalme he
ſayth: <hi>Mercy and truth are met togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, righteouſnes and peace haue
kiſſed ech other,</hi> that is, they come togither in euery worke and gift,
which we obtaine of the Lord by praying.</p>
            <p>In this truſt and confidence thou muſt ſo behaue thy
ſelfe,<note place="margin">We muſt not appoint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God how, when, or where
he ſhall heare our prayers.</note> that thou doe not limit to the Lorde any
bound or ende, day or place, neither appoynt any maner or meaſure of hearing,
but that thou do commit all thoſe things to his diuine wil, wiſedom, and
omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, that thou boldly and cheerefully looke to be heard, and yet not
deſire to know, how, and where, how ſoone, and how long, and by what
meanes. For his diuine wiſedom, ſhall finde a better maner and meaſure,
time and place, then we can thinke, euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that ſhould be done by
miracles. Euen as in the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <pb n="164" facs="tcp:9413:91"/> Exod. 14,
when the children of Iſraell truſted that God would deliuer them, and yet
no poſſible meanes were before their eyes, or in all their thoughts, then
the red ſea opened it ſelfe, and gaue them paſſage, drowning all their
enemies at once. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman Iudith, when ſhe heard that the Citizens of
Bethulia would after the ſpace of fiue dayes giue vp the citie, if God in the
meane time did not helpe them, rebuked them ſaying: <hi>VVhat are ye, that ye

mercy of God, but rather whereby we prouoke him vnto wrath and diſpleaſure.
VVill ye ſet the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Lorde a time, and appoint him a day after your

laſt ſhe fiue Holofernes, and put the enemies to flight, Iudith 13: So S.
Paule alſo ſayth, Epheſ. 3: that the power of God is ſuch and ſo
great, that it doth farre greater and better thinges then we eyther aſke or
thinke. Wherfore we ought to thinke our ſelues more vile, then that we may
name, appoynt, or preſcribe the time, place, maner, meaſure, and other
circumſtances of that which we aſke of God, but we muſt leaue all thinges
wholy vnto him, conſtantly and boldly beleeuing that he will heare vs.</p>

here called a ſupper, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel muſt be the laſt word, which
ſhall continue to the ende of the world. Wherfore the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per here is
nothing els, but a very rich &amp; ſumptuous feaſt, which God hath made
through Chriſt by the Goſpell, which ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs great good things
and rich treaſures. And he ſent his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to byd men to this
ſumptuous ſupper. That is: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were altogither ſent with one
word into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, that they might byd and call men to this ſupper,
with one voyce, with one Goſpell, with one ambaſſade: after ſuch
ſort, that if S. Peter had come, and preached the Goſpell of God in that
place where Paule had preached it before, yet had it bene one worde, and the
ſame preaching, that the hearers ſhould haue bene compelled to ſay:
Behold he preacheth the ſame that we heard before of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they wholy
conſent and agree, &amp; the thinge that they publiſh is all one. That the
Euangeliſt might inſinuate this conſent and agreement in preaching, he
ſayth: <hi>He ſent his ſeruaunt,</hi> he ſayth not, his ſeruaunts, as
of many. Nowe this meſſage the ſeruaunt muſt doe to the bidden
gueſts:<note place="margin">The meſſage which the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth to the
gueſts bidden to the great ſupper.</note> 
               <hi>Come, for all things are now
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> For Chriſt had ſuffered death, &amp; in his death had ſlaine
ſinne and death, alſo was riſen againe from death, the holy Ghoſt was
giuen: &amp; briefly all thinges were prepared which pertained vnto that great
ſupper. All things were ready without al our coſt. For the Father by
Chriſt hath payd the price of all things, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all our merit and
labour we might enioy his goodnes, and be nouriſhed and enriched. He
ſendeth his ſeruaunt therefore firſt to the Iewes, to byd them to this
great ſupper, vnto whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made of God. For the lawe and all
the Prophets were directed hereunto, that they might prepare the people of God.
As the Angel Gabriel declared of Iohn the Baptiſt to his father Zacharias
Luke 1: <hi>He shall be filled with the holy Ghoſt euen from his mothers
wombe, and many of the children of Iſraell shall he turne to their Lord God.
For he shall goe before him in <pb n="167" facs="tcp:9413:92"/> the ſpirit and power of
Elias, to turne the harts of the fathers to the children, &amp; the
diſobedient to the wiſedom of the iuſt men, to make ready a people
prepared for the Lord.</hi> But what did the gueſts aunſwere to the
meſſage of the ſeruaunt? the text follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declareth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But they all with one minde began to make excuſe.</hi> This
is that whereof the Lord ſpeaketh Matth. 10: <hi>He that loueth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or
mother more then me, is not worthy of me. And he that loueth ſonne or
daughter more then me, is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his
croſſe, &amp; followeth after me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What they muſt
do that will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this great ſupper.</note> 
               <hi>is not worthy of
me.</hi> For he that will be partaker of this ſupper, muſt put all thinges
into daunger for the Goſpells ſake, body, goods, wife, children, frendes,
&amp;c. Moreouer he muſt leaue all thinges whatſoeuer they be, that
ſeparate him from the Goſpell, albeit they ſeeme good, iuſt, right,
&amp; holy. Neither thinke ye that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which here excuſe them
ſelues, were gilty of grieuous ſinnes, or occupied about vniuſt matters
and works. For it is not vniuſt to bie, to vſe trade of marchandize, to
maintaine him ſelfe hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly, to marie a wife, to be ioyned in matrimonie.
But therefore can they not come to this ſupper, for that they will not
forſake theſe thinges, but will rather cleaue to them in their hart. Nowe
they muſt be vtterly forſaken and left, when the Goſpell ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
Thou wilt perhaps ſay: I would in deede willingly follow the Goſpell, I
would cleaue vnto it, &amp; doe all other things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, but to
forſake goods, houſes, familie, wife, children, &amp;c: ſurely this is a
hard matter. God hath commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded me to labour, to maintaine my wife and
children, &amp;c. Beholde therefore this is the ſcope and ſumme, that the
Goſpell is the worde of faith and offence, becauſe of which euery faithfull
man doth beare offence willingly. In deede God hath willed thee to doe theſe
thinges, howbeit he hath alſo commaunded, that thou preferre him before all
creatures, and loue him aboue all thinges, and thinke him higher then all
thinges which thou canſt know, euen as the chiefe and greateſt
commaundement giueth vs to vnderſtande: <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God
with all thy hart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy minde, Deut.</hi> 6.
Wherefore thou muſt forſake all thinges before thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to
be pluckt away from the loue of him, or his worde: although in deede he
loſeth nothing, which forſaketh any thinge for the Goſpells ſake. If
for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpells <pb n="168" facs="tcp:9413:93"/> ſake thou loſe this temporall
life, God will giue thee an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther farre better, to wit, eternall life, as
Chriſt ſayth Matth. 10: <hi>He that will finde his life, shall loſe it,
and he that loſeth his life for my ſake, shall finde it.</hi> If thou be
compelled to forſake thy wife togither with thy children, remember that God
hath a care of them, he will be a better father vnto them then thy ſelfe,
which vndoutedly commeth to paſſe, if ſo be thou beleeue. For we haue
very great &amp; rich promiſes that he wil not ſuffer his word to fail, but
will alwayes fulfill it, if we can freely and confidently truſt in him, and
commit our ſelues wholy vnto him. Chriſt ſayth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort Matth.
19: <hi>VVhoſoeuer shall forſake houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or landes, for my names ſake, he
shall receiue an hundreth folde more, and shall inherit euerlaſting
life.</hi> We haue here his words and promiſe: what would we haue more? or
what can we deſire more? wherein therefore doe we fayle? onely in our faith.
Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man commeth to this ſupper,<note place="margin">A ſound faith
required in the gueſts of this ſupper.</note> but he that bringeth with him
a ſincere faith, which God preferreth and loueth aboue all creatures. But how
doth the Lord recompenſe them which excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſelues that they could
not come to the ſupper? The text it ſelfe declareth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then vvas the good man of the houſe angry, and ſayd to his
ſeruaunt: Goe out quickly into the ſtreetes and lanes of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and
bring in hither the poore, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
blind.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Goſpell was firſt to be preached to the
Iewes who becauſe they refuſed it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles turned to the
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> To goe into the ſtreetes and lanes is nothing elſe, but
that whereas the Iewes made themſelues vnworthy of the Goſpell, and did
refuſe it, the Diſciples turned to the Gentiles. For it was enioyned them
of Chriſt, that they ſhoulde not turne them ſelues to the Gentiles, nor
preach the kingdom of God in the cities of the Samaritanes, but ſhould goe
onely to the ſheepe of the houſe of Iſraell, and ſhould feede them
onely, as they did. Now the Iewes ſtriuing againſt this worde, and by no
meanes receiuing it, the Diſciples ſayd, Act. 13: <hi>It was neceſſary
that the word of God should firſt haue bin ſpoken vnto you: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ye put it from you and iudge your ſelues vnworthy of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, lo,
we turne to the Gentiles: for ſo hath the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs, ſaying: I
haue made thee a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldeſt be the
ſaluation vnto the ende of the world.</hi> But what meaneth that which he
ſayth moreouer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruaunt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:9413:93"/>
               <hi>Goe out into the hie wayes and hedges,
and compell them to come in, that myne houſe may be filled.</hi> This is to
be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of deſperat and weake conſciences, which alſo pertaine
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſupper, and are compelled vnto it,<note place="margin">What it is to
compell to come in.</note> but this compulſion is not outward, but inward and
ſpirituall, and is done after this ſort. When the law is preached, ſinne
is ſet before our eyes and reuealed, that a man may come to knowledge of him
ſelfe, ſo that to compel, to enter or come in, doth rightly ſignifie, to
driue ſinne into the conſcience, wherby a man may know that he is nothing,
that all his workes are ſinnes, and ſubiect to damnation, and ſo
ſodainly his conſcience may become deſperate, and his hart faint and
terrified, that all that confidence and opinion of helpe may depart, and man
him ſelfe be able no where to comfort him ſelfe in any thinge, and at the
laſt be driuen to deſpeire of him ſelfe. If ſo be that one be once
after this ſort compelled, then doe not long delay to let him come in, but
deliuer the man out of deſperation. That commeth to paſſe, when thou
comforteſt him by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and declareſt that he is deliuered from
his ſinnes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Beleeue in Chriſt, that he hath made thee free from
thy ſinnes, then ſhalt thou be deliuered and free from ſinne. And this is
the meaning of that which he ſayth: <hi>Compell them to come in.</hi> It is
not to be vnderſtoode of outwarde compulſion, as ſome interprete it, that
wicked and vngodly ones ſhoulde be violently driuen to the ſupper, for this
preuayleth nothing, neyther is it ſo meant in this place. Wherefore it is to
be referred onely to the conſcience, and is inwarde and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Nowe
he goeth on to ſpeake to the ſeruaunte and the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For I ſay vnto you, that none of thoſe men which were
bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, shall taſt of my ſupper.</hi> This is the concluſion, that they
which thinke themſelues moſt certaine that they ſhall come to the
ſupper, and taſt of it, ſhall not taſt of it: The reaſon ye haue
heard. Now briefly the gueſts that are bidden and do not come, are they,
which thinke that they ſhall obtaine the ſupper by their owne workes, verie
much wearying themſelues, thinking aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, that they ſhall taſt
of it.<note place="margin">Why they that were bidden ſhall not taſt of the
ſupper.</note> But the Lord mightely conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ſayth: Not one of
theſe men ſhall taſt of my ſupper. Wherefore moſt gentle Lord? They
haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted no wicked thinge, neither haue bin occupied about vniuſt
matters. Behold, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:9413:94"/> this is the reaſon, for that they haue
forſaken fayth, and haue not confeſſed it freely before euerie one,
neither haue preferred that rich and ſumptuous ſupper before all creatures.
For ſeeing it is ſumptuous, it requireth thoſe men that do iudge it to be
ſo, and do put any thinge in daunger, what ſoeuer it be, that they may be
partakers of it. Thus ye haue the compendious meaning of this text, which I
haue onely briefly runne ouer, if any will expound it more at large, I am well
content he ſo do.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE workes of charitie which we muſt do to our neighbours in
temporall thinges and in corporall neceſſitie, are diſcribed vnto vs in
this text: which the Lorde then declared, when he ſayde a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in
the ſame chapter, that we muſt do well vnto our enemies, and beſtow
benefits vpon them which hate vs: that we muſt bleſſe them that curſe
vs: that we muſt pray for them which perſecute vs: if any man ſmite vs on
the one cheeke, we muſt offer vnto him alſo the other: and if any man take
away our cloke, we muſt not forbid him to take away our coate alſo. &amp;c.
All which he comprehending in a briefe ſumme, ſayth: <hi>Be ye mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
as your Father alſo is mercifull.</hi> Here ye ſee all good workes
ſummarily deſcribed which we muſt exerciſe among our ſelues, as our
heauenly father hath exerciſed them toward vs. Ye haue oftentimes heard, that
it is not needefull to do good workes toward God, but toward our neighbour
onely. God can be made neither ſtronger nor richer by our workes: but man may
be ſtrengthened and enriched by them, vnto whom alſo they are
neceſſarie, vnto whom onely they are to be directed, and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God,
which ye haue very often heard, and which is now in your eares: but would to
God it would at the laſt burſt forth both into your handes and workes.<note place="margin">We muſt deale with God by faith and with our neighbours by good
workes.</note> Marke therefore how peruerſe an order it is, when any deale
with God by workes, with whom notwithſtanding they muſt deale by onely
faith, and when faith is directed vnto man, whereas it is to be placed in God
alone. Turne theſe contrariwiſe, and they ſhalbe right, after this
ſort: let vs firſt repoſe faith in God alone, and let vs then giue our 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9413:95"/> ſelues to ſerue our neighbours, and to direct all our
workes ſo, that they may turne to their commoditie. We muſt deale before
God by no other thing but by faith alone, becauſe none is able to helpe vs
but God onely, &amp; whatſoeuer we poſſeſſe either in mind or body,
that commeth wholy to vs from God alone, in whom we ought to truſt, vpon whom
we ought to ſet our hart. Nowe ſome vſe ſuche a prepoſterous order,
that they repoſe faithe, which ought to haue reſpect vnto God onely, in
them ſelues and others, they reſt vpon their traditions, and whatſoeuer
their great mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue inuented, in that they put their truſt. Of
ſuch God ſayth in Ieremie?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>My
people hath done two euills: one, for that they haue forſaken me the well of
the water of life, and digged them pitts, yea vile and broken pitts that can
holde no water: An other, for that thou dareſt ſay: I am without ſinne
and gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, tush, his wrath can not come vpon me: behold I will reaſon with
thee, becauſe thou dareſt ſay, I haue not offended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt he ſayth, that his ſpouſe is turned into an harlot,
and hath eſtraunged her ſelfe from God the fountaine of life, from whom
life, ſaluation &amp; euery good thing floweth, him they haue forſaken.
Secondly they ſet vp their owne traditions, and digge vnto them ſelues a
fountaine of their owne, which can holde no water. So our Papiſtes truſt to
their owne inuentions, to their founding of Maſſes, to their faſtinges,
prayers, and ſuch like things. Which appeare to be as a fountaine, out of
which they would draw life, and bleſſednes or ſaluation, when as
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is able to hold no water: they forſake God the
foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life. Afterward he ſayth: they dare riſe againſt me, that I
ſhould not be angrie with them, alleging that their workes be iuſt, and
they will goe to law with me. Beholde this is an other ſinne, that they goe
about to defende their workes. Whereupon God alſo ſayth: <hi>I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend
with thee in iudgment, &amp; wil shew how thou gaddeſt hither and thither to
change thy wayes.</hi> So faith pertaineth to God alone,<note place="margin">Faith obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all good thinges of God.</note> whereunto it
belongeth to obtaine all whatſoeuer thinges are neceſſary, as well
temporall thinges as eternall, and ſo to obtaine them, that it thinke not
that it hath merited in any thing. Alſo it muſt againe apply it ſelf
downward toward our neighbour, with out looking for any recompenſe, not that
bleſſednes conſiſteth in that deriuing of faith, to wit charity, for
neither doth God require that, who will haue the conſcience 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9413:95"/> to reſt onely in him: euen as the ſpouſe muſt
cleaue onely to her huſbande and to no other: ſo alſo God requireth of vs
that we truſt in him alone. Theſe things Chriſt declareth when he
ſaith: <hi>Be ye mercifull as your father is mercifull.</hi> Wherefore I
muſt ſo order my conſcience toward God, that I vndoutedly beleeue, that I
haue him a bountifull and mercifull father, as I will afterward declare, and
that I alſo do ſhew mercy toward my neighbour. Which faith muſt be
inward, and caried vpward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but workes muſt be without, and deriued
downward to our neighbour. After this ſort Abraham did, when at the
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in the countrie of Moria he aſcended to God, he left his
ſeruaunts and aſſes below at the bottome of the mountaine, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king onely
Iſaac with him. The ſame muſt be done of vs if we will aſcend vnto God,
that we may come to him with Iſaac one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, with faith, ſeruaunts
and aſſes, that is workes, are to be left below. Thus much for the
entraunce of this text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith and workes, to wit that faith muſt
pearce inward and vpward, but workes muſt go without and downeward, whereby
at the length it commeth to paſſe, that we are righteous before God and
men, for that we giue due honour vnto God, and beleeue according to his word,
and ſatiſfie our neighbour in the dutie of loue. Nowe let vs ſee the very
wordes of the text in order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be ye mercifull as your Father is mercifull.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How our hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly Father is mercifull toward vs.</note> How
therefore is our heauenly father mercifull? after that ſort, that he giueth
vs all good thinges, corporall and ſpiritual, tranſitorie and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
freely and of his mercy. For if he ſhould giue vnto vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our
deſert, he ſhould giue vnto vs nothing but hell fire and eternall
damnation. What ſoeuer therefore good thinges he beſtoweth vpon vs, he
beſtoweth them of his meere mercy. He ſeeth vs ſticke faſt in death,
therefore he hath mercy vpon vs and giueth vs life: he ſeeth vs to be the
children of hell, therefore he taking pitie vpon vs, giueth vnto vs heauen: He
ſeeth vs to be miſerable and naked, hungerie and thirſty, it pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying him
hereof, he clotheth vs, and refreſheth vs with meat &amp; drinke, &amp;
maketh vs full of all good things: So what ſoeuer we haue either in body or
in ſpirit, he giueth it vs of his meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without any merit or deſert
of ours. Whereupon Chriſt here ſaith: Imitate your father, &amp; be ye
mercifull like vnto him. This <pb n="174" facs="tcp:9413:96"/> is not ſimple mercy,<note place="margin">What kinde of mercy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teacheth vs to vſe.</note> ſuch
as reaſon teacheth, for that is greedy of her owne commoditie, which giueth
onely to great and learned men, and to them that deſerue it: it loueth them
that be fayre and beautifull: it giueth vnto them, of whom it looketh for
profit and commoditie againe, which is a mercy diuided, begging, and as it were
torne and broken in peeces. For if I ſhall giue to him that hath deſerued,
or if I ſhall regard fayrenes or friendſhip, it is a bargaine or det, and
not mercy. Hereof Chriſt ſpeaketh in the ſame chapter before this text in
this wiſe:<note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> 
               <hi>If ye loue them which loue
you, what thanke shall ye haue? and if ye do good for them which do good for
you, what thanke shall ye haue? for euen the ſynners do the ſame: and if ye
lend to them of whom ye hope to receiue, what thanke shall ye haue? for euen
the ſynners lend to ſynners to receiue the like.</hi> But the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of
Chriſtians muſt not ſeeke her owne, but ſo behaue it ſelfe, that it
be indifferent, that it regard all alike with open eyes, both freinds and foes,
euen as our heauenly father doth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Where true mercy is not, neither is there any
true faith.</note>And where ſoeuer this mercy is not, neither is there faith
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. For thy heart being ſetled in faith, ſo that thou knoweſt God to

betweene a friend and an enemie, betweene the worthy and vnworthy: for ye ſee
all which are in this text rehearſed, to haue otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of vs,

muſt deale before God with our workes, and by them deſerue the mercy of
God, when as notwithſtanding ye haue very often heard, that faith alone doth
all? and both Paul and the whole Scripture do commonly ſay and affirme, that
we muſt beleeue in God alone, and deale by onely mere faith before him.<note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> It is requiſite here to vnderſtand that
good workes are onely a ſetting forth and commendation of faith, ſo that if
I beleeue, I muſt be mercifull, I muſt not iudge nor condemne my neighbour,

your ſelues. What did Abraham being commaunded to offer his ſonne?<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> he obeyed the commaundement, and drew forth the
ſword to kill his ſonne: what enſued therevpon? the Angell of the Lord
ſtayed him, ſaying: lay not thy hand vpon the child, neither do any thing
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: for now I know that thou feareſt God, foraſmuch as for my ſake
thou haſt not ſpared thine onely ſonne.</p>
            <p>Howbeit this is here to be knowen and marked of vs,<note place="margin">We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue mercy before we ſhew mercy.</note> that we
muſt firſt receiue, before we giue: before we ſhew mercy, we muſt
receiue mercy of God: we do not lay the firſt ſtone, neither doth the
ſhepe ſeeke the ſhepeheard, but the ſhepeheard the ſhepe. Wherefore
ſo beſtow thy workes in euerie reſpect, that thou looke for nothing at
Gods hand becauſe of them:<note place="margin">We obtaine all good thinges of

And in the ende of the ſame chapter: <hi>The time shall come</hi> (ſayth

Paul ſayth Rom. 3: <hi>There is no difference: for all haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and

through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: whom God hath ſet forth
to be a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through faith in his blood, to declare his

patience of God, to shew at this time his righteouſnes, that he might be
iuſt, and a iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of him which is of the faith of Ieſus.</hi> And in
the chapter fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he ſayeth: <hi>Now to him that worketh the wages is not

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9413:97"/> but beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodly, his

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for righteouſnes. For if it be of Grace, it is no more of

eleuenth chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Our good workes muſt be ſignes and
teſtimonies of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere faith.</note>Againe, I muſt beſtow my
workes ſo, that they maye be a certaine ſigne, and as it were a ſeale
grauen with letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may be aſſured that my faith is ſyncere.
For if I feele in my heart, that my worke proceedeth from loue, I am ſure
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the integritie and ſoundnes of my faith. If I forgiue, the ſame
forgiuenes doth aſſure me concerning the ſinceritie of my faith, doth
declare my faith, and certifie me, that God hath alſo pardoned my ſynne,
and doth daily more and more pardon me. So it fell out with Abraham, his worke
made his faith knowne vnto him. God in deede knew that he did beleeue, but it
behoued that Abraham alſo ſhould know, and ſhew forth his faith.
Wherefore workes folowing onely freely as fruites of faith, are declarations of
ſuch a faith. For what ſhould it profit me, if I had euen a ſtrong faith,
but vnknowen vnto me? euen as if I ſhould haue a cheſt full of gold, yet I
being ignoraunt thereof, ſhould take no commoditie thereby. But if any would
ſhew it vnto me, he ſhould do me as great a pleaſure, as if he gaue it
me. So if I haue faith and yet be ignoraunt thereof, it is no profit vnto me.
Wherefore it muſt burſt forth, and be ſhewed by the workes that enſue,
which are both ſignes and ſeales of the preſent faith.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.18.19</note> Soe Sainct Peter meaneth, when ſpeaking

the Scripture, that ye ruſh not vpon them like blinde moules, and confirme
workes in ſuch places as this: for herein workes are reiected if we thinke,
that we are iuſtified by them: but herein they are extolled and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in that they are profitable to our neighbour and frutes and ſignes of faith.
Behold, it was meete that I ſhould make <pb n="177" facs="tcp:9413:97"/> this

            <p>Now if it ſhould be demaunded why God oftentimes ſetteth downe
ſuch contrarie ſentences,<note place="margin">Why God wil haue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
in the Scriptures which ſeeme contrarie.</note> and diſagreeing one with an
other, as it ſeemeth to vs &amp; our reaſon, I aunſwere, that he may
exerciſe vs in reading, and that we ſhould not thinke that we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the whole Scripture, when we ſcarce vnderſtand one place. Some ſayinges
do guide the ſpirit, how we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues toward God, onely
by faith, as this:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note> 
               <hi>VVe are iuſtified
freely.</hi> Againe leſt the body ſhould be ſluggiſh outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there
are ſentences alſo ſet forth vnto vs, which do guide and exerciſe the
body, as theſe which we haue heard here rehearſed: <hi>Forgiue, and ye
shalbe forgiuen:</hi> alſo where as Chriſt affirmeth, that he will require
workes in the laſt day, and will ſay after this ſort vnto the condemned,
Matthew 25: <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meat: I thirſted, &amp;
ye gaue me no drinke: I was aſtraunger, and ye tooke me not in vnto you: I
was naked and ye clothed me not, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſentences, whiles
ignoraunt and light ſpirits labour to wreſt and applie to workes, they
ſee not how great euell they commit. But ſpirituall men referre them to the
very body onely, they them ſelues ſtanding naked before God in ſpirit,
which is both iuſt and neceſſarie. For there are two thinges in man, the
Spirit and the Fleſh. Hereupon there are ſome places which do guide onely
faith in the ſpirit: ſome, which do direct onely workes in the body: for
one place can not direct both the body and the ſpirite togither. We muſt
ſo do with our ſubſtance, that we be willing to part from it, to lend,
and to giue to our neighbour, when it ſhalbe requiſite. And if we ſee any
not to haue, wherewith to make reſtitution, we muſt releaſe him, and
forgiue the dette according to the example of Nehemias, as we read in Eſdras.
1. Eſd. 5. For God hath giuen many things vnto vs, who is able to giue vs moe
thinges alſo if we beleeue. And thus we heare that if we will be
Chriſtians, we ought to lend, giue, and to be willing to part from that which
we haue, otherwiſe we ſhall not ſhew the frutes of a liuely faith.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay vp this text inwardly in your mindes, that ye deale by no other
thing before God, but by onely faith, and referre and beſtow your workes to
the only ſeruice and profit of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Thus much ſhall ſuffice
to haue bin ſpoken concerning the former part. Now what is to be ſayd
moreouer of this text, or <pb n="178" facs="tcp:9413:98"/> what doth follow we will
afterward conſider. In the wordes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord interpreteth
himſelfe, what kinde of mercy he vnderſtandeth, ſaying after this
ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudge not, and ye shall not be iudged: condemne not, and ye
shall not be condemned: forgiue, and ye shalbe forgiuen: Giue, and it shalbe
giuen vnto you.</hi> In this place the Lord diuideth mercy into three
partes,<note place="margin">Three parts of mercy.</note> that we maye not be
ignoraunt, what maner of mercy that ought to be, which it behoueth vs to ſhew
to our neighbours. Firſt iudgement and condemnation is taken from vs. Then
thou muſt forgiue thy neighbour if he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing againſt
thee. Laſtly thou muſt helpe the needy. Theſe thinges this word
<hi>(Mercie)</hi> ſignifieth, where ſoeuer it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the Scriptures.
And all theſe muſt proceede from a ſyncere heart, all colouring and
flatterie being taken away, that there be no reſpect had of the perſon. For
if thou deſireſt to will well and to wiſh well to them, which will well
to thee: or to do well to them, which do well to thee: or to hurt them, which
hurt thee, thou art vtterly deceiued. But thou muſt do ſo, as Chriſt
ſaith a litle before: Imitate thy heauenly father, loue thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: do wel
to him, which doth euel to thee: forgiue him that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee:<note place="margin">The firſt part of mercy not to iudge or condemne an
other.</note> lend to the needy, and ſo of the reſt. That therefore we may
ſpeake of the former part, that we muſt not iudge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, we muſt
marke, that God hath ordained the ſword of the magiſtrate, to the
puniſhing of publike offences, ſo that it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that it be not done
againſt the precept and commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, as that the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be not
executed: for whereas the iudge dealeth vniuſtly, he is as well an homicide
as an other, of which iudgement Chriſt ſaith nothing here. Els where he
maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, when as he ſaid to him, which deſired, that he
would byd his brother diuide the inheritance with him:<note place="margin">Luk.
12.14.</note> 
               <hi>Who made me a iudge or a diuider ouer you?</hi> For the care
&amp; gouerning of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thinges do not belong to the kingdome of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of what iudgement Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in this
place.</note>But Chriſt ſpeaketh here of an other iudgement, namely of that
whereby one reputeth and compteth an other good or euell, when as
notwithſtanding he ſeeth no good or euell to be done of him. Which
iudgement belongeth only vnto God. For it may be that thou ſee thy brother
offend to day, whom notwithſtanding to morow God doth receiue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may he
both be, and alſo ſeeme vnto thee to be good, neither muſt thou remember
his ſynnes, for <pb n="179" facs="tcp:9413:98"/> that Chriſt hath forbidden. For there
can not be either any loue, or concord, where this iudgement and condemnation
is vſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. To iudge &amp; condemne an other is nothing els,
then to haue a beame in his owne eye, which all hypocrites do without dout
beare in their eyes. For they that iudge themſelues good, are offended at
their brother, what ſoeuer others do, it diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, foraſmuch
as they will not acknowledge their owne ſynne. But it commeth to paſſe,
that when thou ſeeſt many ſinnes in others, thou ſeeſt not the beame
that is in thine owne eye, and ſo falleſt into the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God. Hereof
it commeth, that thou which iudgeſt an other, are made worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
moſt wicked baude, or the moſt vnchaſt harlot, before God, who alone
knoweth who is to be ſaued, and who to be condemned.<note place="margin">Iudgers of other.</note> Such hypocrites are of that nature, that
it is a pleaſure vnto them, and they take no ſmal delight thereof, if they
reaſon and talke either of the adulterie or fault of an other man, yea they
increaſe a ſmall thing or trifle in their neighbour, and what ſoeuer
others do, they interpret it at the worſt, ſo that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to do
that which pleaſeth or liketh them. And although they themſelues do not
ſuch things, yet they willingly here that other men do them, whereas a godly
man helpeth as much as he is able, that theſe thinges may be couered and
amended. But it many times falleth out that they are moſt filthie adulterers
euen according to the fleſh, which do ſo iudge and condemne others, howbeit
they do not iudge man onely, but euen God himſelfe. Wherefore if thy brother
be a ſinner, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale his ſynne, and pray for him to the Lord: if thou
reueale his ſinne and reioyce thereat, ſurely thou art not the child of the
mercifull father, for if thou were, thou wouldeſt be mercifull according as
he is. This is a thing moſt certaine, that we are not able to ſhew ſo
great mercy to our neighbour, as God both hath &amp; doth ſhew to vs. But
that is the practize of Satan, that we do thoſe things which are quite
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie vnto mercy, which is an vndouted ſigne, that there is no mercy at
all in vs.</p>
            <p>Of theſe iudgers of other Chriſt ſpeaketh in the Goſpell
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth: <hi>Can the blinde lead the blinde?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 6.39.</note> 
               <hi>shall they not both fall into the ditch? The
diſciple is not aboue his maiſter: but who ſoeuer wilbe a perfect
diſciple, shalbe as his maiſter. And why ſeeſt thou a mote in thy
brothers eye, and conſidereſt not the beame, that is in thine owne eye?
either how canſt thou ſay to <pb n="180" facs="tcp:9413:99"/> thy brother, Brother,
let me pul out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou ſeeſt not the beame
that is in thine owne eye? Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, caſt out the beame that is in thine

is in thy brothers eie.</hi> As if he ſaid: thou thinkeſt that thy brother
is blinde, and in thy minde doeſt fynde fault with an other, that is, thou
wilt guide an other, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thou thy ſelfe art blind. Thou
iudgeſt him a ſynner, &amp; thy ſelfe an honeſt &amp; iuſt man. What

other, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou thy ſelfe art blinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a moule, ſo that he which
foloweth thee, doth fall with thee into the ditch. Of ſuch as iudge
themſelues to excell others, &amp; thinke themſelues to be followed more
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, S. Paul ſpeaketh Rom. 2: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>thou art called a Iew, &amp; reſteſt in the law, &amp; glorieſt in
God, &amp; knoweſt his will, and trieſt the thinges that diſſent from
it, in that thou art inſtructed by the law, &amp; perſwadeſt thy ſelfe,
that thou art a guide of the blinde, a light of them which are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, an
inſtructer of them which lacke diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a teacher of the vnlearned,
which haſt the forme of knowledge, &amp; of the truth in the law. Thou
therefore which teacheſt an other teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? thou that
preacheſt, A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should not ſteale, doeſt thou ſteale? thou that
ſayeſt, A man should not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adulterie, doeſt thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adulterie?
thou that abhorreſt idols, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteſt thou ſacrilege? thou that

them which commit ſuch things. And thinkeſt thou this, O thou man, that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which do ſuch things, &amp; doeſt the ſame, that thou

know not, leading ſo other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ditch with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
ſaith: <hi>The diſciple is not aboue his maiſter, but who ſoeuer wilbe

I can learne no more of my maiſter <pb n="181" facs="tcp:9413:99"/> then he knoweth
himſelfe. Wherefore doth the Lord ſpeake this prouerbe? becauſe of two
ſortes of maiſters: the one is blynde, whom if I ſhall follow, I alſo
my ſelfe ſhall become blynde: he himſelfe falleth into the ditch, and I
follow. The other maiſter is the mercifull father, of whom we muſt learne
mercy: whom if we follow, we alſo do become mercifull like as he is: if we
were mercifull daily, we ſhould alſo become perfect, as he is perfect, but
that commeth not to paſſe, as long as we are in this life.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of mercy is,<note place="margin">The ſecond part
of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue.</note> that we forgiue them which haue endamaged vs, or
hurt vs by any meanes. A Chriſtian can neuer be ſo hurt, but he ought to
forgiue, not onely ſeuen times, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty times ſeuen times, as the
Lord ſayd vnto Peter. Matth. 18. Wherefore God forgiueth a Chriſtian his
ſynne or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he alſo may forgiue other their infirmitie:
which Chriſt ſetteth forth els where in a moſt goodly parable, which he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Matth. 18.35.</note> 
               <hi>So
likewiſe shall mine heauenly Father do vnto you, except ye forgiue from your
hearts, ech one to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their treſpaſſes.</hi> And ſo we praye
daily in the Lords prayer, with an addition ſaying: forgiue vs our
treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs. Is this
a hard matter, if I a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſynner, do forgiue my neighbour his
treſpaſſes and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, whereas the Lord will forgiue me my
ſynnes and my infirmities? If one had killed my father, what were this being
compared to my ſynne, wherewith I haue offended God, and prouoked him to
anger?</p>
            <p>The third part of mercy is,<note place="margin">The third part of
mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to giue to the poore &amp; needy.</note> that we giue to them that be
in miſerie and neede, and that we helpe them. Whereof Iohn ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus
1. Iohn 3: <hi>VVhoſoeuer hath this worldes good, and ſeeth his brother
haue neede, and shutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue
of God in him?</hi> For where the loue of God is, it is moued to ſhew it
ſelfe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in outward works. Hereunto alſo pertaineth the ſaying of
Chriſt Matth. 5: <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they shall obtaine
mercy.</hi> Wherefore the Lord addeth a promiſe in the Goſpell, ſaying:
<hi>Giue and it shalbe giuen vnto you: a good meaſure, preſſed downe,
shaken togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; running ouer shall men giue into your boſome.</hi>
And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing on his ſpeech he ſayth: <hi>For with what meaſure ye
meat, with the ſame shall men meat to you againe.</hi> Thus much ſhall
ſuffice concerning the partes of mercy which we ought to ſhew 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9413:100"/> to our neighbours.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12.</note>
Vnto which the ſpeciall wordes of Chriſt ought to exhort vs, who when in
the Goſpell of Matthew he had ſpoken much of a Chriſtian life, and of
loue to be ſhewed to our brethren, thus concludeth ſaying: <hi>VVhat
ſoeuer ye would that men should do to you, euen ſo do ye to them: for this
is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Now euerie one is ſo affected, that being
caſt downe, and in diſtres, he would wiſh all the world to helpe him. If
I be a miſerable ſinner, drowned in ſinnes, bearing a burdened and
troubled conſcience, I would that the whole world ſhould comfort me,
ſhould helpe and ſuccour me, ſhould couer my ſinne and ſhame. So I
alſo ought to behaue my ſelfe toward my neighbour, not to iudge him, not to
condemne him, but to forgiue him his offences, to helpe him, to prouide for
him, to lend vnto him, &amp; giue him, euen as I would wiſh to be done vnto
my ſelfe if I were driuen into diſtres, neceſſitie, exile, or pouerty.
And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in truly Chriſtians are knowne, if they loue one an other, if one do
ſuch workes of mercy vnto an other, as Chriſt ſayd vnto his diſciples
at his laſt Supper: <hi>I giue you a new commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ye loue one an
other, as I haue loued you. By this shal all men know that ye are my
diſciples, if ye haue loue one to an other.</hi> Thus ye haue the meaning of
this text, it remaineth that we call vpon God for grace.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well knowne vnto you dearely beloued bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Gods worde muſt be heard and learned.</note> with how great
ſeueritie God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his worde to be heard and learned. For he
moſt highly eſteemeth it, and hath beſtowed much labour in defending it,
and publiſhing it to the world. He hath ſuffred all the Prophets to come
into perils and daungers, at the laſt alſo he ſent his owne ſonne
becauſe of his worde, whom he ſuffered to die euen the death of the
croſſe. And what perſecutions haue not the Apoſtles themſelues abode
for the wordes ſake? what afflictions haue not all Chriſtians ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered?
vnto ſome of which he hath committed the miniſterie of his word faithfully
to be executed, and to other ſome hath enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the charge of hearing the
ſame. If there were no other cauſe beſide this, whereby we might be moued
to heare &amp; learne Gods word, but for that it is the good pleaſure, will,
and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, yet this one ought to be ſufficient great &amp;
weighty. For it is our dutie as creatures to obey our Lorde and Creator, and
that with all readines of mynde, inaſmuch as he hath giuen vs ſo many good
thinges, and doth as yet daily giue vs moe, for which we ſhall neuer be able
to giue him ſufficient worthie thankes.</p>
            <p>Howbeit he is not content, onely to haue commaunded vs to do this,
or to require it of vs as bounden dutie, but promiſeth alſo that great
fruits and commodities ſhall redound to vs thereby, affirming that by this
meanes his greateſt and higheſt worſhip is giuen vnto him. For he is the
great Lord, whom we ſerue,<note place="margin">God is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diuers waies,
but eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pecially by preaching &amp; hearing his worde.</note> who hath many
and diuers kindes of ſeruice, and manifold maners of worſhip, and whom we
may ſerue diuers wayes. But this onely ſeruice which is giuen to him by
hearing the word, doth excell all the reſt. For if any where a faithfull man
of the countrie, or a citizen, or any which is otherwiſe in ſubiection doth
ſerue his Lorde or maiſter, he doth by the ſame ſeruice alſo ſerue
God. Likewiſe a childe, a manſeruaunt or a maydſeruaunt, if they be 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9413:101"/> obedient, and do diligently that which belongeth to
their dutie: alſo a Prince and parents if they gouerne well, and do their
du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie faithfully: they all do ſerue God. For it is his will and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement which he requireth to be fulfilled of vs. Of ſuch ſeruices
and kindes of worſhip the world is full. For to euerie one in his ſtate his
workes are committed and inioyned of God, whereby he daily both ought and may
ſerue him: that there may be left no place for excuſe vnto any man, as
though he were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt how, and wherefore he muſt ſerue God, neither
that any ſeeke after other thinges, and inuent peculiar maners of ſeruing
God, which he hath neither ordained nor commaunded, and in the meane ſeaſon
neglect that which he hath commaunded, as we haue hitherto done in our
blindenes.</p>
            <p>But before all other ſeruices and doinges of duties, he hath
moſt highly eſteemed and extolled this ſeruice both of them that
heare,<note place="margin">God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed time, place, perſon and what
ſo euer is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that his word may be preached &amp; heard.</note> and
them that preach his word: And therefore hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained alſo a ſpeciall day
thereunto euerie weeke, in which we muſt applie our ſelues to no other
buſines: Albeit we ſerue God alſo by other labours all the weeke, which
he hath bound to no time or certaine daye. But he hath choſen this daye
ſpecially, which he hath ſeuerely commaunded to be kept, whereby men maye
haue time and leyſure to performe this ſeruice, leſt any might flie vnto
this complaint, that he hath no leyſure by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his labours and
buſines. Moreouer he hath appointed ſpeciall places alſo for this
ſeruice, as among vs temples and houſes, where we doe come togither. Yea he
hath inſtituted and kept the whole order of miniſters hereunto, giuing
alſo other thinges which pertaine to the performing of the charge of this
office, as the knowledge of manye tounges, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers giftes beſide. And
briefely he hath commaunded the whole world by a certaine ſpeciall precept,
that it thinke this worſhip or ſeruice holy, and farre more excellent then
the reſt. Which he will haue ſo to be delighted in of all Chriſtians,
that it maye be manifeſt, howe much he doeth eſteeme it, and howe
acceptable vnto him the exerciſe and handlyng of his word is.</p>

               <note place="margin">Moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cauſes which ought to me to
heare Gods word.</note>Theſe things I ſpeake to ſtirre you vp, and to
admoniſh you, why ye ought willingly to heare the word of God, becauſe it
is not only the commaundement of God, whereunto we muſt obey, 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9413:101"/> but we haue alſo moſt ample promiſes, that it is a
thinge accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and the greateſt worſhip, whereby we can doe
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto him. And it ſo farre exceedeth other kindes of worſhip, as the
brightnes of the ſunne exceedeth the brightnes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtarres, and
the Sabbath day the other dayes, &amp; in a ſumme, as much as the heauenly
kingdom excelleth the kingdoms of the worlde. For here all thinges are holy and
ſpecially choſen, the time, place, perſon, and that becauſe of the
worde, which ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all thinges vnto vs. Wherefore we muſt
earneſtly endeuour, that we take heede vnto our ſelues, that we fall not
into ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; ſlothfulnes, neither that we be caried away with
contempt and lothſomnes of hearing the word, as thoſe delicate and cloyed
ſpirits, which ſeeme vnto them ſelues already to be Maiſters, and
exactly to know all thinges, yea farre more perfectly then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can teache
them. Or as others alſo, which are ſoone cloyed with it, thinking, why I
haue heard this very often, wherefore ſhould I eftſoones heare the ſame
ſonge? They knowe not howe great &amp; meruelous a thing it is, alſo howe
great worſhip of God, which they do ſo greatly contemne, &amp; neglect with
ſo great ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. Wherefore they doe after vnſpeakeable meanes
prouoke God to wrath, hauing his commaundement ſo in contempt, and
ſuffering his promiſe to be made voyd in them, and as much as is in them
impayring and hindering by their example ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable a worſhip and
ſeruice of God.</p>
            <p>But admit it to be true, which notwithſtanding is not, that thou
dooſt vnderſtand all thinges perfectly, and as cunningly and ſkilfully as
Chriſt him ſelfe: yet thou ſeeſt how earneſtly he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the
office of preaching, and applyeth him ſelfe vnto this worke, whereof
notwithſtanding he was moſt ſkilful before, and had not any whit neede
thereof, as we doe greatly neede it. So Paule alſo a Prince of Apoſtles,
albeit he was exceedingly well learned, &amp; ſo excellent a Doctor, yet
going through many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries did eftſoones and euery where preach, neither
was he wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or cloyed.<note place="margin">We muſt not be wearie of hearing
the word of God.</note> Wherefore it is meete that thou be nothing at all
wearie of hearing this worde, inaſmuch as the ayde and helpe thereof is
exceeding neceſſary for thee, both againſt the deuil and all other
tentations. And although for thy inſtruction thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not neede
it, yet oughteſt thou not to be wearied or cloyed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhouldeſt not
beſtowe a fewe howres in a day euery weeke <pb n="186" facs="tcp:9413:102"/> vpon this
worſhip and ſeruice of God: ſeeing that before, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelfe to
falſe worſhip, when thou didſt paſſe the whole day in temples, and
didſt runne from temple to temple, from altar to altar, thou felſt no
tediouſnes or wearines, neither didſt ſay as thou dooſt at this day: O,
I haue heard no newe thinge, I haue heard theſe thinges before: But didſt
thinke thus: this day and yeſterday I went to heare Maſſe, and to morow I
mind to goe to heare it againe. How much more oughteſt thou to doe this now,
knowing aſſuredly that this is the right ſeruice and worſhip of God,
&amp; to ſay? Albeit I knew moſt perfectly, as I doe not know, yet to giue
honour and ſhew obedience vnto God, I will doe this ſeruice, and becauſe
of his loue and prayſe I will heare his word, that my Lord may ſee by this
chiefe worſhip, wherewith I am eſpecially delighted, that I am willing to
ſerue him. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no other frute or profit come vnto me thereby, yet I
may reioyce that I haue performed a moſt holy and acceptable worke vnto him,
whereunto other kindes of worſhips and ſeruices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared, are of
ſmall importance.</p>
            <p>Now, he that doth not care for theſe thinges, neither is moued
with them, reuerently to thinke and highly to eſteme of the word of God,
willingly and earneſtly to heare and learne it, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer opportunitie
and meanes ſhall be offered, I wil haue nothing to do with him. For neither
may I, neither will I draw any man hereunto violently. He that contemneth, let
him contemne ſtill, and remaine a ſwine as he is, euen vntill that day,
when God wil kill him, and throw him downe hedlong to hel. For ſuch a one can
not be a good man, neither is it a humane ſinne, but a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiliſh
obſtinacie,<note place="margin">A deuiliſh obſtinacie to contemne the
hearing of Gods word.</note> ſo greatly to contemne that, whereunto God hath
appoynted a place, perſon, time, &amp;c. Whereunto moreouer he moueth vs by
his commaundement, louingly prouoketh vs by his promiſes, ſtirreth vs vp,
and admoniſheth vs by wordes, and offereth all theſe of his owne accorde,
and to be bought with no price or treaſure, which is to be farre fetched, or
hardly come by, the excellencie whereof can in deede be counteruailed with no
gold. Adde hereunto moreouer that it is a worſhip or ſeruice very eaſie
to be done, which may be performed without all labour or griefe, but that thou
muſt attentiuely heare the Preacher, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy mouth to ſpeake and
read, then which labour none ſurely is more eaſie. And albeit it is to be
feared, that thou ſhalt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="187" facs="tcp:9413:102"/> beare the
croſſe, and ſuffer perſecution, yet the worke it ſelfe is ſo ioyned
with no difficultie, as no other labour is, no not euen that that is moſt
eaſie. If ſo be that it be not grieuous vnto thee, to ſit the whole day
in a tauerne or an alehouſe, or otherwiſe with thy companions to trifle and
ſport thy ſelfe with filthy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely geſtes and paſtimes,
alſo to ſinge and prate, and yet art not wearie, neither feeleſt any
labour: thou mayſt with as litle paine ſit in the temple, and heare the
Preacher, whereby thou ſerueſt God, and dooſt that which is acceptable
vnto him. What wouldeſt thou doe, if thou ſhouldeſt at his commaundement
cary ſtones in quarries, or goe armed on pilgrimage to S. Iames? or if ſome
other laborious and painefull worke ſhould be enioyned thee? as hitherto it
hath bene the cuſtom among vs, when as we would doe all thinges willingly,
whatſoeuer was enioyned vs, when we were deceiued with meere trifles, and
moſt impudent deluſions.</p>
            <p>But ſo doth the Deuill blinde men: in whom alſo he worketh a
ſatietie and lothing of the word of God, whereby it commeth to paſſe that
they haue no regard, what a treaſure the word of God is, but liue after a
beaſtly ſort, contemning all good doctrine. Let vs therfore at the laſt
delight in theſe things, thinking thus with our ſelues, that as often as we
reade or heare the word of God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuatly or publikely, of whom ſoeuer
it be preached, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelues to the chiefe ſeruice of God, which
pleaſeth God exceedingly well. After this ſort thou mayſt inflame thy
ſelfe to heare, and God will inſpire thee with his grace,<note place="margin">God maketh the ſeede of his worde frutefull in the diligent
hearers ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of.</note> that the ſeede of his word be not ſowne in vaine,
but may bring forth plentifull frute. For the word is neuer taught without
frute, whenſoeuer it ſhal be diligently and attentiuely heard, neither can
it be, but that by eftſoones hearing it, thou ſhouldeſt become better.
And albeit for the preſent time thou ſeeſt or feeleſt no frute, yet in
proceſſe of time thou ſhalt plainly perceiue &amp; feele it. But it were
long here to rehearſe the frutes proceeding of the worde, nay, in deede they
can not be all rehearſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges I thought good to ſpeake in ſteede of a
preface before the wordes of S. Paule,<note place="margin">Exhortation to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hearing of Gods word very needefull.</note> to the intent to ſtirre vs vp
more diligently to heare the worde of God: and ſurely there is great neede of
ſuch an exhortation daily in euery ſermon, which alſo is much pertinent
vnto the text which we preſently haue in hande. <pb n="188" facs="tcp:9413:103"/> For
Paule in this place reprehendeth curious ſpirits, which go about by their
owne wiſedom to be maiſters of the word of God, and doe by and by falſely
perſwade them ſelues, that they knowe it well, and that they neede not any
more the help of any teacher: but turne them ſelues to trifleling and vaine
iangling, that they may bring forth ſome new thing, which the common ſort
may be deſirous to heare, preſuming alſo to be Maiſters of the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of all men, labouring to teache euery one, and yet not
vnderſtanding what they ſpeake, or whereof they affirme. For this is a
plague and calamitie that followeth, where the word of God is not handled
diligently and ſeriouſly, the learners being wearie of hearing, and the
teachers ſlothful in preaching. Hereof it commeth that ſo great companies
of hearers ſlide away, and Churches become deſolate. Of which calamitie
vaine talking ſpirits are the cauſe, which promiſe new thinges, that they
may winne the hartes of the multitude vnto them ſelues, boaſting that they
are Maiſters of the Scripture, and yet are alwayes ſuch men, as are
ignorant, foraſmuch as they haue neuer tried, what it is to teach other:
which we doe nowe plainly fee, and the wrath of God is at hand ready to
puniſh our contempt and vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Therefore Paule beginneth his
Epiſtle to his Diſciple Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe ſo,<note place="margin">Vaine &amp;
cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> that he ſhould take heede, that ſuch teachers
doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, which can talke many thinges of the lawe, bringing many new
queſtions and doctrines, what is to be done, how righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is to be
obtained, all which they do for oſtentations ſake, that they may be ſeene
and prayſed, and ſeeme to be more learned then other, and yet they neuer
came ſo farre as to teach any certayne thinge, or that which might be counted
to be of any importance, but doe all thinges confuſedly and out of good
order. Such bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers vſe onely theſe wordes, that we muſt be honeſt,
that good workes muſt be done, and God muſt be ſerued, &amp;c. but they
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the ſenſe of thoſe wordes, what they meane. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſked how we muſt doe good workes, nowe they teach this particular worke to
be done, an other time an other worke, as, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much ſacrifice at this
altar, get thee into this or that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, runne vnto this Sainct, here
erect a chappell to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſuch a Sainct, in an other place founde a
Maſſe, light ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, eate fiſhe, buy indulgences, &amp;c. Which being
done, they by and by bringe an other worke, and forthwith after that an other. 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9413:103"/> So they know not how to inſtruct any after a
conſtant &amp; certayn maner of teaching, much leſſe can they ſay, this
is, or in this doth the ſumme of Chriſtian life conſiſt, &amp;c. And
yet in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thoſe thinges muſt be counted very excellent
that they teach, ſo much doe they boaſt, and promiſe almoſt golden
mountaynes, as though they alone were Doctors that might not be gainſayd, and
controulers and Maiſters of all other.</p>
            <p>But he is to be counted an excellent Maiſter, and highly to be
eſteemed, which teacheth the chiefe point and whole ſumme of doctrine, to
wit, how the hart and conſcience, yea and the whole man muſt liue. They
know nothing of that thing, although they be very full of wordes, but doe
altogither erre from the ſumme &amp; principall point of the lawe. In the
meane ſeaſon they intangle the mindes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearers with ſuch a
confuſed company of words, that they know neither how to make a beginning nor
end of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and it is vncertaine whereunto that diſordered companie
of wordes doth ſerue, whereby no man can be made better, much leſſe can
he confirme his conſcience thereby, as we hitherto haue enough and too much
ſeene and tried in the Papacie amonge our Preachers of dreames. What
therefore is the ſumme of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is to be taught to the
people? Sainct Paule aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth: 
<q>The ende of the commaundement is loue out of a pure hart, and of
a good conſcience, and of faith vnfeyned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is that Helen,<note place="margin">The ſumme of Chriſtian
life.</note> here thou haſt the ſumme of Chriſtian life moſt
excellently and fully comprehended, compendiouſly and briefly vttered, and
which may be not vnfitly printed in thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. Thou muſt endeuour, if thou
wilt not erre from the lawe, but attaine to the chiefe point therof (that thou
mayſt know what is to be done and what to be left vndone) to haue loue
proceeding out of a pure hart, from a good conſcience, and faith vnfeyned. If
thy loue be of this ſort, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it right, otherwiſe thou erreſt from
the meaning of the whole law. Now theſe wordes are profound, and comprehend
muche matter in them: Wherefore we muſt partly expound them, that they may be
the better vnderſtoode, &amp; that we may accuſtom our ſelues to Pauls
maner of ſpeech. Firſt he attributeth to loue the ſumme of the whole
lawe, wherein it <pb n="190" facs="tcp:9413:104"/> wholly conſiſteth.<note place="margin">What it is loue.</note> And to loue is nothing els (as I thinke it
is knowne to all) but to fauour and embrace one from the hart, and to ſhewe
and performe vnto him all the duties of friendſhip and good will. Nowe
thoſe iangling Doctors alſo vſe ſuch wordes, preaching and boaſting
many thinges of loue, but all by peece-meale and particularly applyed to their
owne trifles and follies. Euen as heretikes, wicked men, and vngracious
wretches haue loue alſo, but that which conſiſteth onely amonge them
ſelues, &amp; them that are of the ſame ſorte with them, in the meane
ſeaſon they hate and perſecute all good Chriſtians, whom they would
willingly accuſe of murder, if they could, &amp;c. But this doth not yet
deſerue to be called true loue, if I chooſe one or two, whoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
like &amp; pleaſe me, whom I do friendly &amp; louingly embrace, &amp; no man
beſide them. It is called a particular loue, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not out of a
pure hart,<note place="margin">Loue flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a pure hart.</note> but from
an infected and filthie hart. For true loue floweth out of a pure hart, when I
endeuour as God hath commaunded me, to poure forth my loue toward my neighbour,
and to fauour all without difference, whether they be friendes or enemies, euen
as our heauenly father him ſelfe doth, who ſuffereth his Sunne to ariſe
on the good and euill, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his raine to the thankfull and
vnthankfull, maketh the earth to bring forth many good thinges, giueth money,
riches, fruites, cattell, and many times eſpecially vnto them that are the
worſt of all other. But from whence commeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doing of theſe things?
truely from pure loue, whereof his hart is moſt ful. This he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth forth
abundantly vpon all, omitting no man, whether he be good or euil, worthy or
vnworthy. And this is called true, diuine, entire, and perfect loue, which
loueth no one, neglecting the reſt, neither cutteth or diuideth it ſelfe,
but imbraceth all indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Loue that proceedeth not
from a pure hart of what ſort it is.</note> The other is loue of theeues and
Publicanes, if I loue him, which is for my turne, and may doe me a pleaſure,
and which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth well of me, and deſpiſe him that contemneth me, and
which is not on my ſide. For that doth not proceede from the hart which ought
wholy to be good and pure, indifferently toward al, but he that is endued with
ſuch loue, ſeeketh his owne thinges, &amp; is full of loue of him ſelfe,
and not of loue toward others. Neither doth he loue any man, but for his owne
commodities ſake, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely that, which may ſerue for his owne
vſe, ſeeking his owne profit by euery man, and not the profit of his
neighbour. If <pb n="191" facs="tcp:9413:104"/> he be prayſed and honoured, he laugheth,
but being looked vpon with ſower countenaunce, or an vnthankfull word being
ſpoken vnto him, he ſtomacketh, curſeth &amp; findeth fault, ſo that
all friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip forthwith ceaſſeth. Contrariwiſe he that hath a pure
hart muſt be ſo affected according to the worde of God, and his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he fauour euery one, and beſtow liberall and friendly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits vpon
them, euen as God hath fauoured him, and of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue hath beſtowed
benefits vpon him.</p>
            <p>But ſome man will ſay, he is myne enemie,<note place="margin">We
muſt not therefore abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing well to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is our
enemie or euill.</note> and doth euill vnto me. Surely he is an enemie alſo
to God, vnto whom he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe thinges diſpleaſant vnto him, then he
can doe either to me or thee. But therefore my loue ought not to be
extinguiſhed or ceaſſe, becauſe he is euill, and altogither vnworthy
thereof. If he be euill, he ſhall at the laſt ſuffer puniſhment
according to his deedes, but his wickednes muſt not ouercome me. But if I can
through loue rebuke and admoniſh him, or pray for him, that he may amend, and
eſcape puniſhment, I muſt do it readily: I muſt not be an enemie vnto
him, or doe euill vnto him in any wiſe. For what profit ſhould redound vnto
me thereby? neither am I made better thereby, and I make him ſo much the
worſe. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to delight me, if I ſhall fauour him, and
beſtowe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits vpon him, if ſo be that he will ſuffer them to be
beſtowed on him, and pray vnto God for him, ſo I may enioy peace, and haue
no trouble or contention with any man, and perhaps I may ſo profit him, that
he wil change his life vnto the better, and amend. Otherwiſe ſurely loue
being diuided or ſeparated, I haue more bitternes and ſorrow by them, whom
I hate, then I haue ioy and profit by them, whom I loue and keepe companie
with. And this is ſayd to trouble the fountaine or water, from whence pure
loue can not flowe. As it is certaine that the Iewes alſo did, againſt whom
Paule ſpeaketh in this place: for they loued them onely of whom they were
loued, whereby they defiled the ſynceritie of loue with mans affections, and
therefore their hart could not be pure.</p>
            <p>But whereby is the hart purified? I aunſwere,<note place="margin">Wherby the hart is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> it can not be purified by any
other thing better, then by that ſoueraine puritie, which is the word of God.
Receiue that into thy mind, and order thy life according to the rule thereof,
and thy hart is purified. As in this place, ſee thou ſet the word before
thee, <hi>Thou shalt loue <pb n="192" facs="tcp:9413:105"/> thy neighbour as thy
ſelfe,</hi> &amp; follow that which it commaundeth, and by and by thou
ſhalt ſee whether it purgeth &amp; clenſeth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer deſire there
is in thee of thyne owne profit, or whatſoeuer loue of thy ſelfe. For
commaunding thee to loue thy neighbour, it maketh exception of none, either
friend, or foe. Albeit ſome man be euill, and hath bene oftentimes iniurious
vnto thee, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he doth not therefore loſe this name, that he
is not to be called thy neighbour, but neuertheles remaineth thy fleſhe and
blood, and is comprehended in theſe wordes, thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour
&amp;c. Therefore I ſay, if thou ſhalt conſider him and ſo behaue thy
ſelf toward him, as the word teacheth thee, then is thy hart made pure, and
loue ſincere, ſo that thou makeſt no falſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of perſons,
neither otherwiſe conſidereſt him, then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is good, and one
of thy familiars. In deede we can not deny this to be true, that an honeſt
man is more worthy to be loued, vnto whome alſo euery one doth more willingly
applye him ſelfe by nature, then vnto the conuerſation of wicked men,
whoſe familiaritie there is no good man that doth not abhorre, howbeit
fleſh and blood is the cauſe that true and Chriſtian loue is not among
vs. For a Chriſtian muſt not deriue his loue from the perſon, as the
world doth: as ſome yong man ſeeing a maide, is in loue with her becauſe
of her fayrenes and beautie, and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man taketh his loue and deſire
of his money, a Lorde or Prince of honour and power, &amp;c. For all ſuch
loue is ſayd to be feyned and proceeding not from whence it ought, cleauing
to the good thinges, wherewith he ſeeth the perſon adorned, neither doth it
continue any longer, then that which he loueth, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and as long as he
may enioy it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">True loue.</note>But true loue ought to be
ſuch as floweth out of a continuall fountaine, and proceedeth from the bottom
of the hart, as a freſh and continuall water alwayes ſpringing forth, which
can not be ſtopped, and is neuer dryed vp. This loue ſayth after this
ſort: I loue thee, not for thy honeſtie or diſhoneſtie, for I doe not
deriue my loue from thy honeſtie, as from a ſtrange fountaine, but out of
myne owne fountaine, that is, out of the word of God which is planted in my
hart, which commaundeth me to loue my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. From hence loue plentifully
floweth, open to al, which haue neede thereof, watering all both friendes and
foes: yea chiefly prepared and ready for foes, inaſmuch as they haue more
neede, <pb n="193" facs="tcp:9413:105"/> that they may by my meanes be brought to
amendement, I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and doing according to my abilitie that which
I am able, that they alſo leauing their euill wayes, may be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from
ſinnes, and the ſnares of the Deuill. And this is ſayd to be loue flowing
from the hart, and not deriued from without: for he that is endued with ſuch
loue, findeth no ſuch thinge in him whom he loueth, from whence he ſhould
deriue it: But becauſe he is a Chriſtian, becauſe he layeth hold on the
word, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither pure by it ſelfe, by the power of it his hart
alſo is made pure, and repleniſhed with true loue. Whereupon he poureth
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the treaſures of his
loue toward euery man, neyther is he moued or turned awaye with the perſon of
any, whether he be good or euill. Behold, thus ſhould they preach, which will
right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach loue required of the lawe, whereof our bablers knowe nothing,
neither haue any regard thereof, albeit they talke many thinges of the lawe,
and diſpute much of loue. They doe not ſee, no they doe not ſo much as
once thinke, that loue muſt be ſuch, that it flow out of the hart, &amp;
that the fountaine muſt be firſt pure and cleare. This neuer deſcendeth
into their hart, although they heare, read, and teach many things of it. They
are occupied with very vncertayne, and vnprofitable cogitations, yea rather
with dead dreames.</p>
            <p>Wherefore whatſoeuer is preached of workes and of a good
life,<note place="margin">True good workes.</note> that onely is well done which
proceedeth from the worde of God, a pure hart, and a true faith. This thou
mayſt ſee in all ſtates, how euery one ought in his calling to doe the
office inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and exerciſe the workes of loue. A ſeruaunt
labouring, &amp; thinking no more then thus: My Lorde or Maiſter payeth me my
wages, for which onely I ſerue him, otherwiſe I would not vouchſafe to
looke vpon him, &amp;c: hath not a pure hart, for he doth not ſerue, but for
a peece of bread, or for his hyre, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, his ſeruice
alſo ceaſſeth.<note place="margin">How a good ſeruaunt ought to be
affected.</note> But if he were a right &amp; true Chriſtian, he would rather
be thus affected: I will not therefore ſerue, becauſe my Maiſter payeth
me wages, becauſe he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt or vnhoneſt, &amp;c: but therefore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5.</note> becauſe the word of God doth thus
ſpeake vnto me: <hi>Seruaunts be obedient vnto your Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as vnto
Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> This ſeruice proceedeth of it owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord out of the
hart, which layeth hold on the word and greatly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth it, ſaying: I
wil ſerue my Maiſter, and take my wages, <pb n="194" facs="tcp:9413:106"/> but this
ſhal be the chiefeſt thing, for which I do this ſeruice, that I may
ſerue my God and Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath layd the condition and
ſtate of a ſeruaunt vpon me, which I knowe doth pleaſe him in me, &amp;c.
Here thou ſeeſt a true worke proceeding out of a pure hart. So alſo let a
Lord or Prince, and they which haue the charge of gouerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common weale,
thinke thus: God hath committed vnto me the office of a Magiſtrate, that I
ſhould be a ruler: now if I will haue regard vnto this onely, that I may
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy my dignitie, riches, and power, it is certaine that my hart is not pure,
and yet in the meane ſeaſon I doe the works of a ruler, ſo, that the
world can not complaine of me, neither Ceſar, or the Lawyers can blame or
finde fault with me by their lawes. Euen as neither a ſeruant ſeruing onely
for wages can be reprehended of the world, whether he ſeeketh his owne
thinges or not. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worde of God is not regarded in the office of a
ruler that doth ſo, but his owne idoll, his owne glorie, money and power
&amp;c. But if this affection be in his hart:<note place="margin">How y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of
a godly Magiſtrate ought to be affected.</note> becauſe I am occupied in
this office, wherein God hath placed me, and the word commaundeth him that
beareth rule to be carefull, it is meete that I doe execute the ſame with all
faithfulnes and diligence, to the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my God: The execution
of the office of ſuch a ruler endued with ſuch a mind, commeth out of a
pure and ſincere hart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both God and good men are delighted. There
is moreouer in him loue, which doth not cleaue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſon or outward
things, but beginneth in the hart, which the worde of God maketh mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
which foraſmuch as it is pure &amp; cleane, doth alſo purifie the hart. And
ſo his gouernment and works are the meere ſeruices of God, &amp; moſt
acceptable ſacrifices vnto him, ſeeing that they are done onely according
to the word of God, and for God his ſake. But our talkers can not teach this,
neither are able to iudge of it, only crying out when they teach beſt of all,
that we muſt be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. They bring a certaine iuridiciall ſermon out of
the lawes of men, as Ceſar and his Clerkes teach. But how the hart is
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, they haue neuer ſo much as vnderſtoode or thought any thing
thereof, or how loue is to be deriued to all ſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men
according to the word of God.</p>
            <p>Thus muſt thou ſay moreouer euen in ſpiritual offices &amp;
ſtates alſo: If I or any other ſhall preache to get ſome good benefice,
whereas otherwiſe I would eaſily ceaſſe from doing this office, 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:9413:106"/> I may preache the Goſpell, but my hart is not pure,
but moſt plainly polluted. Therefore although I doe longe and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that it is a good worke and a weighty office, yet doe I not performe it aright,
foraſmuch as I doe it not from the hart.<note place="margin">How y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of a
true Preacher &amp; Miniſter ought to be affected.</note> But then onely it
is rightly done when the hart hath this affection: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I muſt get my
liuing thereby, yet this ought not to be the chiefe ende thereof, but becauſe
God hath called me vnto it, and hath committed it vnto me diligently to be
done, it remaineth, that I doe with all diligence labour therein to the glory
of God, and ſaluation of ſoules, which I doe otherwiſe alſo for the
loue of the word, willingly and from my hart. Hereby I ſeeke neyther loue or
friendſhip, nor honours, nor thankefulnes of men, but my workes come from the
hart, which I firſt doe, before I obtayne any honour, glorie, rewarde, money,
or fauour, although if thoſe come and followe, I may haue and receiue them
without ſinne.</p>
            <p>Lo, thus the word is the cauſe, foundation, ground, fountayne
and ſpringe of loue comming out of the hart, &amp; of all good works that
pleaſe God, which he can by no meanes away with,<note place="margin">God
requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the hart.</note> if the hart be not pure before: for neither are
workes acceptable to men, which are done without the hart by diſſimulation.
Nowe it Ceſar and men require the hart, although they can not ſee it, of
howe muche greater eſtimation is that hart before God, which doeth all
thinges for the wordes ſake? Therefore he alſo ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his word to be
preached, that we may order all our life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcription
thereof. And let not vs ſuffer our ſelues to be hindered, frayed from it,
or diſcouraged with the let or hinderance of any thinge, although for it we
ſhall ſuffer all kinde of loſſes, vnthankefulnes, contempt, &amp;c: but
let vs breake and goe through all brunts with a boulde and manly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and
ſay thus: we beganne nothinge for any mans ſake, neither will we leaue of
any thinge becauſe of any man, but that we may doe that which is acceptable
to God, we will goe on ſtil, howſoeuer thinges fall out with vs. They which
doe thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come men excellent and moſt highly to be eſteemed, who are
ready to doe all duties, and ſerue God with all readines of minde and loue
not feyned. For the fountaine and ſpringe is good, not deriued and brought in
from without.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges I thought good briefly to ſpeake of the firſt 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9413:107"/> part, howe the hart is purified by the worde alone, and
not as the Munkes haue dreamed, by a fight taken vpon them againſt euill
cogitations, &amp; by feyning of good thoughts. For what thoughts ſoeuer thou
ſhalt feyne, the hart ſhal remain vncleane, if the word of God be not in
it, although it pretende a great ſhewe of a godly life, as Paule
witneſſeth. But this purenes, wherof he ſpeaketh, doth extend farther
then outward &amp; corporal purenes doth, which the Iewes did vſe, eating
&amp; drinking their hands being oftenwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which our religious men alſo
vſe in their faſting, diuerſitie of apparel, orders and rites, &amp;c:
for this is called purenes of the ſpirit, which we then haue, when being
inſtructed by the word of God, we know thereby how he is to be ſerued in
euery ſtate &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and endeuour to frame our liues according
thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond part.</note>Nowe followeth the
ſeconde parte concerning a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereof alſo we muſt
intreate, to wit, that loue muſt come from ſuch a hart, as hath a ioyful
&amp; quiet conſcience, both toward God,<note place="margin">A good and quiet
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men.</note> and alſo toward men. Toward men ſo, as
Paule glorieth of him ſelfe, that he liued ſo, that he offended no man,
troubled no man, was an euill example and burden to no man, but all that did
ſee and heare him, muſt needes witnes, that he indifferently ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all,
helped all, counſelled all, &amp; delt friendly and gently with all. Such a
conſcience Moſes alſo glorieth of againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeditious, Numb. 16:
<hi>Thou knoweſt that I haue not taken ſo much as an aſſe from them,
neither haue I hurt any of them.</hi> And Ieremie chap. 18: <hi>Remember, O
Lorde, how that I ſtood before thee to ſpeake good for them, and to turne
away thy wrath from them.</hi> Likewiſe doth Samuel 1. King. 12: <hi>I haue
walked before you from my childhood vnto this day: beholde here I am beare
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of me before the Lord, &amp; before his anointed: whoſe oxe haue I
taken? or whoſe aſſe haue I taken? whome haue I done wrong to? whom haue
I hurt? or of whoſe hand haue I receiued any brybe?</hi> and ſo forth as
followeth in the ſame place. Such boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting &amp; glory euery Chriſtian
muſt attaine vnto, that he do ſo liue toward euery man, and ſo exerciſe
and ſhew his loue, that no man can worthely complaine any whit of him,
whereby he ſhal trouble or diſmay his conſcience, but that all that wil
confes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, may be enforced to ſay, that he hath ſo liued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
hath bin an example to euery man of liuing wel, which will onely but follow
him. And this is called a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience before men, or againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints <pb n="197" facs="tcp:9413:107"/> and reprehenſions of men. And albeit ſuch
a conſcience is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtand before the iudgement of God, no nor any
purenes of the hart in the outward life and works of loue (we continuing in
ſinning often times before God) yet we muſt attaine vnto ſuch a hart,
that we may comfort our ſelues before him alſo, and ſay: this God hath
bidden and commaunded to be done, therfore I do it with a pure hart and a good
conſcience, neither would I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly doe otherwiſe, neither of purpoſe
hurt or trouble any man, but whatſoeuer I ſay and doe, that is willed and
commaunded of God. Let no Chriſtian ſuffer ſuch a confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be
wreſted from him, that he may boaſt him ſelfe by the worde of God
againſt the whole world. For he that hath no regard how he leadeth his life,
that he may ſtoppe the mouthes of all blamers and accuſers, and cleare him
ſelfe before all, and teſtifie that he hath liued, ſpoken, and done well,
he I ſay is not yet a Chriſtian, hauing not in him ſelfe a pure hart and
loue. For we wil not preſume of the doctrine of faith, as though that being
had, euery man may doe what he liſt, whether it be profitable or vnprofitable
to his neighbour, that we muſt in no caſe doe. Otherwiſe that doctrine
ſhould haue the name to giue licence and free libertie for euery one to doe
what he will. But we muſt ſo behaue our ſelues, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine loue
out of a pure hart and a good conſcience, that no man may accuſe vs of any
crime.</p>
            <p>And although theſe thinges be ſpoken of our life and works,
and a Chriſtian is an other maner of man before God, as we ſhall heare, yet
we muſt earneſtly endeuour our ſelues in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that we may be
without blame before God. And when we ſhall not attayne thereunto, we muſt
flie to prayer, and ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men: forgiue vs our treſpaſſes,
&amp;c: that at the leaſt wiſe, our life may remayne without blame,<note place="margin">What we muſt doe when we fayle in our dutie toward our
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> and we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a good conſcience before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if
this can not be brought to paſſe by perfect loue and purenes of the hart,
yet let it be done by humilitie, that we may praye for, and deſire of all men
pardon of our offences, when as we haue not purely and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly done our
dutie, or are not able to doe it, ſo that thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be enforced to
ſay, albeit thou haſt greatly hurt me, or haſt not done thy dutie toward
me, as it was meete, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as thou humbleſt thy ſelfe, I will
willingly forgiue thee, and take it in the beſt parte. And for this
humilities ſake <pb n="198" facs="tcp:9413:108"/> I ſay that thou art a good man,
which dooſt not ſtande obſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as though thou wouldeſt aduiſedly
and of purpoſe offende a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, but dooſt turne thy ſelfe vnto
loue. Therefore that life is as yet ſayde to be without blame, which albeit
it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to reprehenſion, is with humilitie couered, and reformed,
that no man can worthely complayne thereof. Thus the lawe ſhould be expounded
and handeled, that both loue toward euery man may rightly proceede out of a
pure hart for God his ſake, and the conſcience may ſtande before the
world. And this ought to haue bene practiſed of thoſe vayne talkers in
their Sermons, their colde trifles and vaine follies being neglected and left
of. But that all theſe thinges may ſtande and be of force before God
alſo, there yet remaineth one thinge, which pertayneth hereunto, which is
that that followeth.</p>
            <div n="true faith" type="part">
               <head>And of faith vnfeyned.</head>
               <p>For as I haue ſayde, albeit I haue a good conſcience before
men,<note place="margin">Our olde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam doth hinder vs that we can not attaine to
perfect pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.</note> and doe exerciſe loue out of a pure
hart, yet the olde Adam, that is, fleſh and blood remaine in me ſubiect to
ſinnes, whereby it commeth to paſſe that I am not altogither holy and
pure. And as Paule ſayth Gal. 5: <hi>The flesh luſteth againſt the
ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> And Rom. 7. he affirmeth that he muſt fight a daily
fight againſt him ſelf, becauſe he can not do that which is good, &amp;
yet he would willingly do it. The ſpirit in deed would very willingly liue
pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; perfectly according to the worde of God, but the rebellious
fleſh reſiſteth the deſire thereof, aſſailing vs with many and
great tentations, that we ſhould ſeeke honour, wealth, riches, pleaſure,
&amp; ſhould become ſlothful &amp; negligent in our ſtate &amp; duty. So
there remaineth a continual fight in vs, becauſe of the vnpurenes of our
perſon,<note place="margin">Although we haue a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and do
exerciſe loue out of a pure hart before men, yet the ſame can not ſtand
before God.</note> wherein there is not yet ſincere purenes, nor a good
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience &amp; perfect loue, vnles there be perhaps ſomewhat before men.
But before God many thinges are found lacking in vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are worthy of
blame, although all things be perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men. For examples ſake:
although Dauid can obtayne that confidence before men, that he can be
reprehended of no man, and the holy Prophets Eſay, Ieremie, &amp;c: do glory
&amp; are ſure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they haue done according to their dutie, is
right and well done, ſeeing it is the word and commaundement of God, wherein
they haue exerciſed them ſelues with a pure hart &amp; a good
conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet can they not ſtande by this confidence before the
iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="199" facs="tcp:9413:108"/> of God, but are compelled to ſay: if we
ſhould ſtriue with thee in iudgement, then no man ſhall haue ſo good a
conſcience or ſo pure a hart, which doth not dread thy iudgement, and
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him ſelfe to be worthy of reprehenſion and blame. For God hath
reſerued that prerogatiue vnto him ſelfe, that he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in iudgement
with euery one, albeit he be holy, and accuſe him of deadly ſinne: neither
is there any ſo holy, whom he may not iudge and condemne as worthy of
deſtruction. Wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both the hart be pure &amp; the conſcience
good before men, yet muſt thou endeuour to attaine vnto this alſo, that the
ſame may be likewiſe good before God, that he may not find fault with them,
but that they may be ſafe and quiet from his iudgement, as they are before
men.</p>
               <p>Hereunto now pertayneth the thirde parte, that is faith.<note place="margin">The third part.</note> And this is the principall part and chiefe
precept, contayning all the reſt in it, that we may knowe, that where loue is
not yet perfect, the hart not ſufficiently pure, and the conſcience not
quiet, and God doth yet finde ſome thinge which is worthy blame, where the
worlde can finde fault with nothinge, faith muſt moreouer come, and ſuch a
faith, which is not fayned, and defiled with confidence of a mans owne holines.
For whereſoeuer this is not, there the hart is neuer purified before God,
neither ſhall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be able to ſtande, if they be examined by
ſeuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and exact cenſure. Men in deede ſhall not iuſtly
blame me, albeit I glory, that I haue ſerued them by preaching, helping,
gouerning, and by doing the dutie of an ouerſeer or ruler, &amp;c: with all
faithfulnes. And if I haue done any thing more or leſſe then I ought, I am
ſorie at my hart, for I would very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue done all thinges that I
ought. Wherefore I am quiet &amp; already excuſed, neither haue they any
more, which they may rightly require of me, but are enforced to acquite and
diſcharge me. But here I muſt attayne vnto this alſo, that my hart be
ſo pure, and my conſcience ſo good before God, that he may not by any
meanes accuſe and condemne me. Howbeit we finde not this in ourſelues,<note place="margin">We can not of our ſelues attaine to a pure hart &amp; a good
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</note> although we may glorie ſomewhat thereof
before the world. I muſt therefore obtayne ſome other thing whereunto I may
truſt, if I ſhall come into perill, and within the throwing of the dart, as
it is commonly ſayd, and I muſt ſay to my feareful and terrified
conſcience, I haue done that which I haue bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:9413:109"/>
and who knoweth how often I haue done leſſe then I ought? for I coulde not
ſee and marke all thinges, as Dauid alſo ſayth Pſal. 19: <hi>VVho can
vnderſtand his faltes?</hi> Therefore I can lay no foundation of truſt vpon
my owne holines and purenes. Wel, I haue the word, ſo liue, loue, and haue a
good conſcience, which is pure and holy. But this I want, that I can not
conclude, that that is in my hart, neither doe I finde ſo good a conſcience
in me, as the lawe requireth of me. For there is no man liuing in the earth,
which can ſay this truely, I knowe that I haue done all thinges, and that I
doe owe nothinge before God. But the moſt holy ones muſt ſay thus: I haue
done ſurely according to my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that which I haue bene able, but I haue
offended muche oftner then I knowe. Wherefore our owne conſcience doth witnes
againſt vs, accuſing and conuincing vs, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worlde we are
moſt free from reprehenſion or blame. For it muſt followe the worde which
ſayth: this thou ſhouldeſt haue done, this thou ſhouldeſt haue left
vndone. It can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the iudgement of this, nor aunſwere to the
accuſation thereof, but is at the leaſt wiſe enforced to ſtande in an
vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, being wholy wrapped in douting. But if it dout, then is it by
and by conuinced: for it ſtandeth not before God, but flieth and
trembleth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">By what meanes we attaine to ſuch purenes
and a good conſcience as can ſtand before God.</note>Wherefore the
principal part of our doctrine muſt here helpe vs, to wit, that our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt being ſent of the father, did come into the world and hath
ſuffered and died for vs. Whereby he hath reconciled the good will and fauour
of the father to vs, his wrath being appeaſed, and doth nowe ſitte at the
right hande of the father, hauing regarde of vs as our Sauiour, and as a
continuall Mediatour and Interceſſour for vs, making interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for
vs, as for them which can not haue and obtayne of them ſelues ſuch purenes
and a good conſcience. Therefore by his helpe and benefite we may ſaye
before God: although I am not pure, neyther haue a good conſcience, yet I
cleaue to him by faith, which hath perfect purenes and a good conſcience,
which he gageth for me, or rather which he giueth vnto me. For he alone is he,
of whome we reade written, as Peter, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie chapt. 53 ſaye: <hi>vvho
did no ſinne, neyther vvas there guile founde in his mouthe.</hi> And this
prayſe belongeth onely vnto him, neyther hath he any neede to praye, forgiue
vs our dettes, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:9413:109"/> neither of that article of the Creede, I
beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes, &amp;c: but he is free and quiet in
perpetuall, pure and perfect righteouſnes and purenes, vnto whoſe charge
none can lay any thing, nor accuſe his conſcience of any crime, not man,
not the deuell, no not God himſelfe: for he himſelfe is God, who
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can not accuſe himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And this is called faith neither coloured nor fained, which, the
conſcience ſtriuing and trembling, dareth come forth in the ſight of God,
and ſay: Almightie God, I am innocent before the world and quiet in minde,
ſo that noe man can lay any thing to my charge, or fynde fault with me. For
albeit I haue not done all things, yet I aſke pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euerie one, that he
will forgiue me for God his ſake, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I againe forgiue all. By this
meanes I haue cut of the complaints of all, who haue no more which they may
rightly lay againſt me. But before thee I muſt lay aſide this truſt and
confidence, and muſt wholy acknowledge the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of innumerable
ſynnes, and ſay as Dauid ſayd Pſal. 143: <hi>Lord enter not into
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with thy ſeruaunt: for in thy ſight shall no man liuing be
iuſtified.</hi> Wherefore I can not contend with thee, if thou requireſt an
account of my life.<note place="margin">We muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudgement
ſeat to the mercy ſeat.</note> But I appeale from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat to
the mercy ſeat, I do eaſily ſuffer, that I be dealt with according to law
&amp; right before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat of the world, and I will willingly
aunſwere, and will do what I am able: Howbeit before thee I will not come
into iudgement, but I deſire grace, which I take holde of on euerie
ſide.<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat.</note> For thus the Scripture
teacheth me, that God hath ſet two ſeates before men: the one a iudgement
ſeat, for them which are yet ſecure and vntractable, &amp; acknowledge not
their ſinnes, neither wil confeſſe and acknowledge them: the other a
mercy ſeate,<note place="margin">The mercy ſeat.</note> for miſerable &amp;
fearfull conſciences, which feele their ſinnes, dread the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
God, and do earneſtly make requeſt for grace. And this mercy ſeat is
Chriſt himſelfe, as Paul witneſſeth Rom. 3. whom God hath ſet forth
vnto vs, that we might haue refuge vnto him, being not able to ſtand before
God by our owne power. Vnto him I wil applie my ſelfe, if I haue done or do
leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is meete: and how great purenes and goodnes ſoeuer my heart
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience haue before men, I will haue it here to be altogither
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and hidden, and couered as it were with a

                  </gap>ant, yea with a fayre
heauen, which may mightely defend it, which is called <pb n="202" facs="tcp:9413:110"/>
grace and remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynnes. Vnder the defence thereof my heart and
conſcience muſt creepe, and remayne ſafe and quiet. For ſo he
commaunded his Apoſtles to preach &amp; publiſh, that through his name all
that beleeue in him, ſhal receiue remiſſon of ſynnes. Againe, <hi>He
that shall beleeue and be baptized, shalbe ſaued.</hi> And Ioh. 3. he
ſaith: <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he hath giuen his onely begotten
Sonne, that who ſoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue
euerlaſting life.</hi> Therefore God hath ſet forth the mercy ſeat vnto
vs, whereunto he leadeth vs from the iudgement ſeat. Let vs leaue other
before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat, namely thoſe proud holy ones, contemners and
perſecuters of the word of God, where they ſhall heare ſentence according
to their deedes. We will ſuffer theſe to abyde in their circle, vntill they
haue humbled themſelues: but we will not abyde in this circle, but will
depart from it as farre as we ſhalbe able, into the circle of the mercy feat,
vnto which we do appeale. Neither haue we inuented this of our owne braine, but
it is the word of God himſelfe, which threatneth horrible iudgement to them,
which come with their owne holines, and truſting thereunto, do hope that they
ſhalbe able to ſtand before God the iudge, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the mercy ſeat of
Chriſt. For the ſentence ſtandeth, that they ſhalbe ſet before the
iudgement ſeat, as Chriſt ſayth Ioh. 3: <hi>He that beleeueth not is
condemned alreadie, becauſe he hath not beleeued in the name of that onely
begotten Sonne of God. He that beleeueth in him is not condemned,</hi> that is,
ſhall not come to the iudgement ſeat, but to the mercy ſeat, where there
is no wrath or rigour, but grace &amp; forgiuenes of ſynnes, all thinges
being remitted which be not pure, yea being blotted out and ſo conſumed, as
a droppe of water is conſumed of the heat of the ſunne. For where the mercy
ſeat reigneth, there is nothing els, but meere forgeuenes and remiſſion
of ſynnes.</p>
               <p>This therefore being knowne, we muſt exactly vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the
difference betweene the Lawe and the Goſpel, whereof we often teach.<note place="margin">The office of the Lawe.</note> The lawe draweth vs to the
iudgement ſeat, requiring of vs integritie of life, loue out of a pure heart

and will reaſon with thee, and haue thoſe things to be performed which it

then wilt thou turne thee? Here the Lawe vrgeth thee by all meanes, and thine
owne conſcience being witnes, accuſeth thee, requiring the ſentence of
the iudge againſt thee. Then muſt thou deſpeire, there is no counſell
or helpe to be had, except thou knoweſt to flie from the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat to
the mercy ſeat, as for example: Admit ſome Biſhop die in his owne
holines, who while he liued was as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, of a good life, and
acknowledged Chriſt no otherwiſe then a cruell iudge (as it hath bin
hitherto preached of him, neither hath he bin otherwiſe ſet forth, as he is
alſo wont to be vnto ſuch, not of his owne nature, for in deede he is
moſt gracious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, but becauſe they eſteeme him for no other
in their heart) behold this man is a hinderaunce vnto himſelfe, that he can
not obtaine any grace. For he knoweth no difference of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat
and the mercy ſeat, yea he is altogether ignoraunt, whether there be a mercy
ſeat, from which he ſo erreth, and muſt be bound to the iudgement
ſeate.</p>
               <p>But we teach thus,<note place="margin">How Chriſt muſt be
lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of.</note> that Chriſt is ſo to be learned and
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that we be moſt certainly perſwaded that he ſitteth before
miſerable and trembling conſciences, that beleeue in him, not as an angrie
iudge, which commaundeth forthwith to carie violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them that be giltie vnto
puniſhment, but as a gentle, louing, and comfortable Mediatour, betweene my
fearefull conſcience and God, which ſayth vnto me: If thou be a ſinner,
and aſtonied, and the deuell laboureth to drawe thee to the iudgement ſeat,
then ſee that thou flie vnto me, and feare no wrath or anger. Wherefore? Euen
becauſe I ſit here, that, if thou beleeue in me, I may make
interceſſion for thee to my father, that no anger and ſeueritie may hurt
thee: for all anger and puniſhment ſhalbe ſooner layde vpon me, then be
borne of thee. Howbeit that can not be: for he is the onely beloued ſonne, in
whom all grace and fauour dwelleth, whom as often as the father doth behold, he
can not but repleniſh both heauen and earth with grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and
forget all wrath and diſpleaſure. And what ſoeuer he ſhall aſke of
his father, that he ſhall forthwith obtaine with out all repulſe or
deniall. So by faith we are made wholy bleſſed and <pb n="204" facs="tcp:9413:111"/>
ſafe, ſubiect no more to any damnation, yet not for our owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and
purenes, but for Chriſtes ſake, to whom we cleaue by faith as to our mercy
ſeate, being aſſuredly perſwaded, that with him there remaineth no
anger, but meere loue, and pardon and forgiuenes of ſynnes. Thus the heart is
purified before God, and the conſcience made good and quiet, not in reſpect
had of mine owne purenes of life led before the world, but by truſt and
confidence of that excellent treaſure, which my heart apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which is
vnto me in ſteede of a pledge and fulnes, when as before God I am not able to
paye.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially take heede, that our
faith be not falſe or feyned.</note>But herein the whole force of the matter
conſiſteth, that we do againe and againe take heede, that our faith be not
falſe, or as Paul ſpeaketh, fained. For if this erre, and deceiue vs, all
things deceiue vs. For there haue bin many in all ages, as there be alſo at
this day, which can ſpeake many thinges of faith, and wilbe maiſters not
onely of the law, but euen of the Goſpell alſo. Who ſay the ſame that
we do, that faith performeth &amp; doth all things, but that the Law and good
workes are alſo to be ioyned vnto it, and that otherwiſe, if theſe be not
added, faith auaileth nothing. In which words they mixe &amp; mingle togither
our life &amp; workes, and Chriſt. But this is not purely and ſyncerely to
haue taught faith, but to haue coloured, defiled and corrupted faith, ſo that
it can no more be called faith, but a feined colour &amp; counterfecting of
faith, the truſt and confidence of the heart ſtanding not purely toward
Chriſt, as the onely mercy ſeate, but being grounded vpon our one holines,
as being able to ſtand before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat. Wherefore doing thus, we
are moſt rightly caſt of before God, and condemned vnto deſtruction
whereof we are moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. For if faith muſt be pure and voyd of all
counterfecting and faining, then theſe two thinges, Chriſt and my workes
muſt be rightly diſcerned and ſeuered one from the other. For this is
plaine euen to him that is blinde, that Chriſt and his workes are not my life
and my workes, but are ſeparated from the Law and from the workes of all men,
yea and that by a greater diſtaunce, then man is vnlike or differeth from
man. For neither can I ſay, that I and Ceſar or the Biſhop of Rome are
the ſame thing, yet I am much neerer and liker vnto either of them, then a
mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man and a ſinner is vnto Chriſt the Lord, whoe is not onely a pure
and holy man, free from all ſpot and blot, but is moreouer 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:9413:111"/> God alſo. Therefore let the Lawe and the purenes of
thy heart, yea and thy good conſcience auaile in earth onely toward men: But
where the mercy ſeat is, to wit at the right hand of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the
Mediatour betweene thee &amp; God, thither no mans workes &amp; merits ought to
haue acceſſe, much leſſe be they there of any force or value. Wherefore
Chriſt is purely to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all my life, deedes and workes, and
we muſt without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception conclude, that he is an other thing then our life
led be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men with a pure heart and a good conſcience, albeit it be led
euen perfectly and without blame. For it being preſented before God, and by
the lawe brought to the iudgement ſeat, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and loſt. But
Chriſt is the mercy ſeat, and all that cleaue vnto him by faith, can not be
condemned and iudged. So the iudgement ſeat togither with the lawe and all my
life goe into one part: but my faith muſt flie and lep farre vnto an other
part, and ioyne it ſelfe vnto him which is pure, and hath no ſynne, of whom
the Scripture ſpeaketh: he that beleeueth in him ſhal not be confounded.
Becauſe he is preſent in the ſight of the father, and maketh
interceſſion for me. Moreouer he giueth me his owne purenes and holines,
that being clothed and adorned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I may be able to ſtand before God,
and all wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure may be taken away, in ſteede whereof I may
enioy meere loue and fauour.</p>
               <p>Loe, thus faith remaineth pure and free from counterfecting, for
it reſteth not vpon my workes, that becauſe of them it ſhould behoue God
to be gentle and fauourable vnto me, as a falſe and fained faith doth, which
mingleth togither mans merits and the grace of God, and although it hold the
words of Chriſt, yet hath it the confidence and truſt of the heart
repoſed in it ſelfe, ſo,<note place="margin">A fained faith is no ſure
founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that truſt vnto it.</note> that it is
certaine, that it is onely a colour which can not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. For the
matter commeth at the laſt to this point, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that God is
fauourable vnto thee becauſe of thy life led without fault or blame, thou
muſt deſpeire and ſay: who knoweth what I haue done? whereby am I
certaine that I haue neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing through carele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes, or that nothing is wanting in me? In this
doutfulnes of minde the foundation faileth, ſlideing away vnder thee like
vnto ſand moued or ſtirred, and ſo faith is of no force or value at all.
Wherefore it is not vnfitly called fained and painted faith, through which one
ſeeth as it were through a <pb n="206" facs="tcp:9413:112"/> lattis or painted
glaſſe, through which the thinge that is ſeene repreſenteth the colour
of the glaſſe, and yet is not in deede of that colour. So they alſo
beleeue that that affection is in God, that he vouchſaueth to regard our
workes and merits. Which they paint forth according to their owne opinion and
dreames, which are vtterly falſe, raſh and vnaduiſed. And ſo iudgeing
God &amp; all things according to them, they ſee only as it were through a
lattis or painted glaſſe. But ſo onely thou ſhalt behold him with pure
and cleere eyes, if thou do wel ſeparate the iudgement ſeat and the mercy
ſeat one from the other, that heauen with the ſtarres thereof may remaine
pure to grace &amp; remiſſion of ſynnes obtained by the Mediatour, where
Chriſt reigneth with his workes, and the earth alſo with her trees and
herbes, whither we muſt be referred with our workes. The matter I ſay
muſt be brought of vs to that paſſe, if we will ſtand with a right and
an vnfained faith before God, that we do purely diſtinguiſh and ſeuer our
ſelues, our life, and Chriſt or the mercy ſeat: and he that will not do
this, but preſenteth himſelfe before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat with a bold
courage, ſhall feele the reward of his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I my ſelfe haue bin in
that daunger, and as it were a mouſe hauing taſted pitch haue runne away,
reioyſing greatly that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie was giuen me to attaine to the mercy ſeat,
and now I am enforced to ſay, that albeit I haue liued very well before men,
yet all things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted of me contrariwiſe, do remaine beneath vnder the
iudgement ſeat, to be puniſhed according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and iudgement
of God.<note place="margin">Only Chriſt is our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort and meanes whereby we
attaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Now I haue no other comfort, nor no other helpe
and counſell of my ſaluation, then that Chriſt is my mercy ſeat, who
hath neuer offended, hath defiled himſelfe with no ſynne, who died and
roſe againe for me, and ſitteth now at the right hand of the father, &amp;
defendeth me vnder his ſhadow and protection, that I neede not doute, that I
am by his benefite and interceſſion ſafe before God from all wrath and
terrour of iudgement. Thus faith remaineth in all thinges pure, ſetting no
other thing before it ſelfe, whereunto it may boldly truſt, but Chriſt
alone.</p>
               <p>Now he that knew this well, ſhould be a man of a reſolute
minde. For all other haue to do with a fained faith, boaſting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges
of faith, but mingling all thinges together, like as vintners mixe wine with
water, by this that they ſay, if thou liue <pb n="207" facs="tcp:9413:112"/> thus, God
wilbe fauourable vnto thee, and they make the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of the mercy
ſeat, and the mercy ſeat of the iudgement ſeat, which by no meanes can
be, for the iudgement ſeat ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, &amp;c. Wherefore ſeparate
theſe two one from the other as farre as thou ſhalt be able, that they come
not togither, namely, thy life and holines togither with the iudgement ſeat
into one place, which may driue &amp; enforce thee to haue a good conſcience,
and to lead an vpright life before men. But offer thy ſynnes to the mercy
ſeate to be tranſferred into an other place, where God louingly receiuing
thee, will embrace thee as a beloued ſonne, and will neuer remember more any
wrath or ſynnes. If ſuch doctrine of faith were ſet forth vnto men, then
ſhould it be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well done, and all other thinges ſhould follow of
their owne accord, as purenes of heart and goodnes of conſcience, through
right and perfect loue. For who ſoeuer is by faith quiet in his heart, and
aſſured that he hath God fauourable vnto him, who is not angry with him,
albeit he hath deſerued his wrath diuers wayes, he doth all thinges with a
glad and cherefull minde. Moreouer he liueth ſo alſo toward men, that he is
louing and beneficiall toward all, although they be not worthie of loue. He is
quiet toward God through Chriſt the Mediatour, who will not throw him downe
hedlong into hell, but doth louingly fauour him, and lifteth him vp into
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this is the chiefe quietnes, and principall point and foundation of
our ſaluation. Afterwardes he doth in his life ſhew himſelfe dutyfull
alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his neighbour, doing all the beſt thinges he is able vnto him,
what ſoeuer his ſtate or dutie commaundeth or requireth. And when he doth
leſſe then is meete, he aſketh pardon of his negligence before God and
men, ſo that there is left occaſion neither to him, nor to the world
afterward to rebuke him, power alſo to deuoure him is taken from hell, &amp;
to teare him in peeces, from the deuell. Thus a man is ſaide to be in all
things perfect,<note place="margin">How we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> toward men by
loue, and toward God not by the lawe, but by Chriſt, whom he apprehendeth by
his faith, as the mercy ſeat: Which gageth his holines for the beleeuers, or
rather giueth it to them, ſo, that in him they haue all thinges that are
neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now this is right and pure doctrine, which ſhould be
exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and taught vnto men diſtinctly, that they might know how 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:9413:113"/> they may be able to ſtand both before God and men,
that faith and loue be not mingled togither, or life referred both to God and
men. This ought to haue bin perfourmed of thoſe glorious and arrogant
teachers, ſeeing that they wilbe counted maiſters of the law, that the
difference of the law and faith might be well knowen vnto all.<note place="margin">Very hard to learne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true doctrine of faith.</note> For
although it be taught and repeted with neuer ſo great diligence, yet
notwithſtanding it is very hard to be wel and throughly learned, eſpecially
to vs which haue bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and trained vp in the doctrine of workes,
and led onely to the lawe and our owne workes. To theſe may be added our
nature alſo, verie prone and ready by it ſelfe hereunto, and now brought
into a cuſtome, whereby it is confirmed, and in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of time turneth
the heart alſo into exerciſe and vſe, ſo, that we can not abſtaine,
nor thinke otherwiſe, but, that God wilbe fauourable vnto vs, which haue done
ſo great workes, and haue led our life ſo without blame or fault. Therefore
we muſt ſtriue againſt both our nature &amp; cuſtome. For ſurely it
is a very hard thing to thinke or be perſwaded otherwiſe, and ſo purely
to put a difference betweene faith and loue, the filth ſtill hanging vpon vs
and cleauing vnto vs, albeit we be now in faith, ſo that our heart can
ſcarce rule it ſelfe, that it ſay not: ſo long time haue I taught the
Goſpell, ſo haue I liued, ſuch great workes haue I done, &amp;c. And we
would very willingly haue God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our life, and turne his mercy ſeat
for our cauſe into a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat. Thou mayſt vſe this boaſting
toward men, I haue done well to all as I haue bin able, and if any thing be
wanting, I as yet wil endeuour to make a recompenſe. But if thou be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to go vnto God, I aduiſe thee to ceaſſe from ſuch arrogant boaſting,
and thinke to appeale from iudgement to grace.</p>
               <p>Let who will begin and proue this thing, he ſhall at length
ſee and trie,<note place="margin">A hard thing to truſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our owne
workes and holines.</note> how grieuous and heard it is, for a man that hath
bin occupied all his life time in the workes of his owne holines, to eſcape
out, and with all his heart by faith to cleaue to this one Mediatour. I my
ſelfe haue now preached the Goſpell almoſt twentie yeares, and haue bin
exerciſed in the ſame daily by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; writing, ſo that I may wel
ſeeme to be ryd of this wicked opinion. Notwithſtanding I yet now and then
feele the ſame old filth to cleaue to my heart, whereby it commeth to
paſſe that I would willingly ſo haue to do with God, that I might bring 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9413:113"/> ſome thing with my ſelfe, becauſe of which he
ſhould for my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines ſake giue me his grace. And I can ſcarce be
brought to commit my ſelfe with all confidence to meere grace, which I
ſhould doe: for we ought to flie onely to the mercie ſeate, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as
God hath ſet it before vs for a ſanctuarie, which muſt be the refuge of
all them that ſhalbe ſaued. Wherefore it is not to be merueled at, if it be
grieuous vnto others, ſo purely to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and lay holde of faith: but
eſpecially to ſuch as be yet hindered and entangled of deueliſh
preachers, of whom Paul ſpeaketh, which crie out againſt the doctrine of
faith, and in theſe wordes vrge the workes of the Lawe, Doe this and thou
ſhalt liue: Alſo, if thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
&amp;c. Which in deede are true and right, if thou didſt alſo rightly
vnderſtand them. Declare vnto me the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe wordes,
otherwiſe I know ſufficiently already, that I ought to be righteous and
keepe the commaundements. But how muſt I attaine hereunto? or what is it to
be righteous? If thou ſaieſt that it is, to haue a good conſcience and a
pure heart, and to doe all thinges, that God hath commaunded: Well, be it ſo,
but heare ye then, goe to, performe me that, or at leaſt ſhew one, that
dareth ſay that he hath perfourmed it. For thou ſhalt not yet ſo purifie
my heart and conſcience with thy doctrine, that God can not accuſe and
condemne me. But now the Lawe (as it hath bin ſufficiently declared)
requireth ſuch a heart, as hath a good conſcience before God. How therefore
do we obtaine ſuch a conſcience? This is the queſtion and the cauſe,
whereof the controuerſie is. Truly it commeth not hereof,<note place="margin">How we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a good conſcience.</note> becauſe thou
tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt the iudgement ſeate, that is, the Lawe, but from hence, for that
we haue a pure and vnfained faith, which layeth holde of Chriſt, in whom it
moſt fully obtaineth all thinges which the Lawe requireth. So at length all
thinges are brought to paſſe in me hauing a good conſcience, inaſmuch
as I am now made righteous and iuſtified before God. For although that many
things be as yet found wanting in me, yet he ſtandeth on my ſide, who hath
ſo much righteouſnes, as wherewith he is able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie both mine and
all mens defects.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſhew the way whereby we are made righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, when as they, when they teach beſt of all,<note place="margin">Teachers
&amp; vrgers of the Lawe.</note> ſhew onely the waye to attaine to honeſtie
and righteouſnes which is of <pb n="210" facs="tcp:9413:114"/> force and value before
men, contending that it ought to be of force before God alſo, mingling
together all thinges in one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they haue no certaine knowledge
thereof, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not what they ſay or what they affirme. For, to
what ende tendeth this thy immoderate cry? He that will enter into life, let
him keepe the commaundements, &amp;c. in which wordes thou ſhalt not ſhew
the way to attaine righteouſnes: for deſcend a litle into thy ſelfe, and
examine thy ſelfe diligently, then ſhalt thou fynde thy ſelfe to haue bin
in time paſt conceiued and borne in ſynnes, and to liue in the ſame nowe,
and not to be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which the lawe requireth. Why therefore
doeſt thou ſeduce other with vaine wordes, ſaying? be thou righteous and
thou ſhalt be ſaued, which is to no purpoſe, neither foloweth there any
frute thereof, the waye being not ſhewed by which we attaine to
iuſtification? I heare the wordes well, what things the lawe requireth, but
how ſhall we attaine vnto abilitie to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill them? Then ſpeakeſt thou
to me againe and ſaieſt, thou muſt doe good workes. But how ſhall I
ſtand before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, if I haue long and much wrought good
workes, and am righteous before men, as thou teacheſt me? howe ſhall I be
certaine, that I ſeeme ſuch a one to God alſo? For here my hearte and
conſcience be ready to witnes the contrarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">True doctrin concerning Chriſtian
righteouſnes</note>Howbeit I ſhould haue bin thus taught of thee, as Paul
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly teacheth, that righteouſnes muſt proceede from faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned,
and before all thinges the mercy ſeate muſt be layd hold of, from whence
all thinges that are wanting in vs are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And ſo in deede theſe
wordes, keepe the commaundements of God, are rightly vnderſtood. For the
lawe, requireth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſnes in thee, being of force as well before
God as before men: thou hauing obtained this, goe forth into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie and
aſſembly of men, and exerciſe loue, and doe good workes. By this order
and meanes ſomething is brought to paſſe, and ſuch ſayinges of the
Scripture are fulfilled. For ſo man doth that which the lawe requireth,
firſt before God, not by his owne ſtrength or vertues,<note place="margin">How a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> but by
Chriſt, without whom we can doe nothing before God, and ſecondly by his
owne ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour before men. And he is now perfectly righteous, inwardly by faith
in Chriſt, and outwardly alſo by his workes, yet ſo, 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:9413:114"/> that there is place amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men for mutuall pardoning of
offences. Therefore the righteouſnes of Chriſtians doth much more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in forgiueing, then in their owne workes. Thoſe vaine pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
doe peruert the order of this doctrine, and without prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of forgiuenes,
doe teache that workes onely are to be vrged.</p>
               <p>Loe, thus Sainct Paul reprehendeth the errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of
them, which ſpeake much of the lawe, and repete it in daily ſermons,<note place="margin">Vaine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> and yet they themſelues doe not
vnderſtand or ſhew the waye, how the lawe muſt be fulfilled, knowing
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo wel as to babble forth and often to repete theſe wordes, that
the lawe, the commaundements are to be kept, if thou wilt be ſaued, good
workes muſt be done, &amp;c. As they do at this daye fill all bookes with
ſuch confuſion of wordes, and in all their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons vtter nothing els,
then ſuch vaine babbling, which they themſelues vnderſtand not. But they
neuer ſaye worde of thoſe thinges whereof Paul here ſpeaketh, namely of
the ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, how loue muſt flowe out of a pure heart,
a good conſcience, and faith vnfayned, they ſay no more, but keepe the
commaundements. They leueling at the true marke do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hit it: therefore
they corrupt and fulſifie all thinges, loue, the heart, the conſcience
&amp;c. For the head of the fountaine is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that is, ſyncere fayth,
which if it be not right and ſound, all thinges muſt needes be corrupt,
which ſhall flow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from it. And what ſoeuer they teach, it is a
conceit of their owne imagination, and like to deluſions, not vnlike alſo
to thoſe thinges, that are ſeene through a lattis or glaſſe, which
reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the colour of the cleere glaſſe, and yet in deede are not of
that colour. They thinke that God will regard them, when they liue ſo before
men, as it ſeemeth good to their obſcure opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But if God were of that
opinion, he might then haue well kept ſtill Chriſt and the Goſpell. For
what neede or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſhould moue him, to ſend Chriſt from
heauen, who ſhould purchaſe that vnto vs with his precious blood, which we
our ſelues haue before with vs? He ſurely ſhould be the fooliſheſt of
all men, which would poure forth a precious treaſure, which no man
needeth.</p>
               <p>Thus thou ſeeſt how theſe men teach their owne dreames,
whereof they themſelues know or haue tried no certainty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:9413:115"/> doe any thing els but fill men with errours, being not
able to declare, how that which they teach is to be attained vnto. They draw
men vnto workes, whereby they confirme them in their olde nature and cuſtome,
out of which they were to be drawen. Theſe truly are grieuous and odious men,
and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely verie ſharpely accuſed and reprehended of Paul: and it
appeareth that they were of no ſmall authoritie and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing
that he pronounceth of them, that they were called and would be counted
doctours of the Lawe, and farre greater and worthier then the Apoſtles
themſelues.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt endeuour to lay vp and print this text euen
in the bottom of our heart: for it is excellently well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and is pure
and perfect doctrine, teaching how we muſt be righteous before God and men,
as the Lawe requireth, that theſe three maye be as it were conioine in vs,
namely, a pure heart, a good conſcience, and fayth vnfayned: and that our
life may flow out of all theſe, and be occupied and led in them: then haue we
attained, and fulfilled the meaning of the Lawe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we muſt moſt
diligently take heede, and endeuour to draw Chriſt vnto the Lawe, who is the
ende and fullfilling of the Lawe, and our righteouſnes and fulnes before God,
which we fynde not in our ſelues, and without fayth ſhall neuer fynde,
albeit the Lawe be taught and often repeted without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and
knowledge. And theſe thinges maye ſuffize to haue bin ſpoken at this
preſent for the expoſition of this place. ⸪⸪⸪

this text is ſet forth vnto vs, how ſubtil reaſon and mans wiſedome
agree with the wiſedome of God, and how fouly reaſon ſtumbleth, when it
ſtriueth to be euen moſt ſubtil and wiſe, as it here falleth out with
the Phariſees, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were the beſt and moſt wiſe of
the Iewes, which euen by this their ſubtiltie they declare: neuertheles their
wiſedome is here proued to be fooliſhnes. They could blame Chriſt neither
for his preaching nor for his workes, and yet would they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue had
occaſion to put him to death, wherefore they thought to ſet vpon him moſt
craftely and wilely, propounding a ſubtil queſtion vnto him, the
ſubtiltie whereof was ſuch, that mans reaſon was not able to comprehend
it, then which alſo a ſubtiller could not be inuented: and thus they
ſpeake vnto him:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſubtill queſtion of the Phariſees
propounded vnto Chriſt.</note>
               <hi>Maiſter, we know that thou art true, and
teacheſt the waye of God truly, neither careſt for any man: for thou
conſidereſt not the perſone of men. Tell vs therefore, how thinkeſt
thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Ceſar or not.</hi> Here thinke they,
we ſhal entrappe him. For he ſhalbe compelled to aunſwere that tribute is
either to be giuen, or not to be giuen. If he affirme that it is to be giuen,
we haue ouercome him: but if he denie that it is to be giuen, then is he giltie
of death. Whereas they ſay, <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> they will thereby moue him,
and as it were conſtraine him to aunſwere the truth. But whereas they
ſay, <hi>We know that thou art true,</hi> they do thereby put him in minde of
his duty. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore ſhould Chriſt turne himſelfe? for there
ſeemeth to be no way for him to eſcape, yet he would not for all that fall
into their net. Was not this a ſubtil queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Do they not ſhew
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue bin ſufficient craftie and wily ones? for which way
ſoeuer the Lord had aunſwered, he had bin taken. Was not this done alſo
full warely and circumſpectly? for they aſſociate to themſelues the
miniſters of Herode, thinking no other but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappe him with deceit, that
he ſhould not by any means eſcape, thus caſting in their mindes: Now we
will meete with him well enough, if he denie that tribute is to be giuen, the
Herodians are preſent, which ſhall forth with put him to death as a
ſeditious felow, and one that reſiſteth the Romane Empire. But if he
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that tribute is to be giuen, he ſpeaketh againſt the libertie of
the Iewes, then will we ſtirre vp the people againſt him. For 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:9413:116"/> the Iewiſh people would be free, and haue their king
of their owne ſtocke, euen as it was promiſed them both of Moſes and God,
that their kingdome ſhould continue vntill the time of the true king, that
is, of Chriſt. Euen as the Patriarch did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof:<note place="margin">Gen. 49 10.</note> 
               <hi>The ſcepter shal not depart from Iuda and
a law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from betweene his feete, vntil Silo come.</hi> And therefore God
did chooſe this people ſpecially to himſelfe, and made a kingdom of them,
onely for Chriſtes cauſe. Moreouer there were many ſentences in the
Scripture which declared that they ſhould ſerue none, <hi>For they should

peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heads, wherewith they were greatly diſturbed: euen as at this day it
is put into the peoples minde, that the Church cannot erre. Hereupon the
Phariſees thought thus: If he affirme that tribute muſt be giuen, he
blaſphemeth G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, he
ſhalbe giltie of death, as one iniurious to God, and then ſhalbe ſtoned
of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For God hath graunted and promiſed libertie vnto this
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they were all euen in the middeſt of captiuitie the people of
God. Howbeit at that time they wanted a king, as they do at this day. Wherefore
diuers tumults, ſeditions, &amp; vprores were ſtirred vp among them. For
they were taught by the lawe, that they ſhould haue a king of their own
fleſh and ſtocke, as it is ſaid before, wherefore they did
vnceſſantly ſtriue againſt ſtraunge kings and gouernments, vntill not
a few of them at times were beaten &amp; ſlaine. Neither did this happen
ſeldom times, for they were a ſtiffenecked, obſtinate, and vnruly nation,
&amp; therefore the Romaines which at that time did beare rule ouer them, did
verie circumſpectly gouerne them, and diuided the land into foure charges of
gouernment, that being on euerie ſide kept in awe by the gouerners and
preſidents, they might not ſo ſoone flocke together and moue ſedition,
and that they might alſo be more eaſily reſiſted if at any time they
ſhould riſe againſt the Romane Empire. Wherefore Pilate was appointed of
the Romains lieftenant of Iudea, Herode Tetrarch of Galile, his brother Philip
Tetrarch of Iturea, and of the countrie of Trachoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, and Lyſanias the
Tetrarch of Abilene, as Luke rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them. And all this was done that
they might keepe the Iewes vnder, whereupon the Iewes were inflamed with
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in a rage and furie, but ſpecially in the time of Chriſt 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:9413:117"/> they would willingly haue had a king.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſubtill imaginations of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
againſt Chriſt.</note>Wherefore the Phariſees hauing fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out this
deuiſe, thought thus with themſelues: Well, we haue the matter now at a
good ſtay. The Romanes chalenge to themſelues the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, now if he
aunſwere vnto the queſtion that tribute is not to be giuen, the lieftenant
is at hand and ready to put him to death: if he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that it muſt be
giuen, he ſhall ſtirre vp the people againſt himſelfe, and ſo we
ſhall aſſuredly by this meanes entrappe him: thus they ſuppoſed that
either they ſhould fynde cauſe of death in the Lord, or at the leaſt make
his doctrine to be nothing ſet by of the people. As the Iewes here do, ſo
alſo do we, the chiefe and neceſſarie thinges being left, we are occupied
about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not neceſſarie. The Phariſees here moue a
queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be free or otherwiſe: foraſmuch as they had the
Lawe and the word of God, they ſuppoſed that they ought to be ſubiect to
none, but to their owne Kinge, yet they were now compelled to obey Ceſar
Emperour of Rome. They had Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the loue of God and their
neighbour, but that being left, they are occupied about other matters. It was
promiſed vnto them, if they obeyed the precepts and commaundements of God,
that they ſhould then be a free people, they diſobey and neglect Gods
commaundements, and yet notwithſtanding they wil be free, and haue their owne
king. In like maner falleth it out with vs, we earneſtly chalenge to our
ſelues Chriſtian liberty, and yet we thinke, that if we doe thoſe thinges
that ſeeme good in our owne braine and fantaſie, we are thereby
Chriſtians, both faith and charitie being of vs neglected. But what doth
Chriſt, the Phariſees ſo ſubtilly ſetting vpon him? he ſtriketh
them with their owne ſword, and entrappeth them in their owne deuiſe,
whereby they thought to haue entrapped him, aunſwering nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe
thinges which they hoped he would, as the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt doth more at large
deſcribe, ſaying:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Ieſus perceiued their wickednes &amp; ſaid: VVhy tempt
ye me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The wiſdom of Chriſt in confounding the craft
and ſubtilty of the Phariſees</note> 
               <hi>ye hypocrites? Shew me the tribute
mony. And they brought him a peny. And he ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: VVhoſe is this
image &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? They ſaid vnto him, Ceſars.</hi> Here thou
plainly ſeeſt the wiſedom &amp; meruelous dexteritie of Chriſt, he
willeth the tribute money to be ſhewed vnto him, and aſketh of the image
and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription therof. They aunſwering that it is Ceſars, he very
well <pb n="217" facs="tcp:9413:117"/> and moſt freely inferreth, that they are vnder
Ceſar, vnto whom they were compelled to pay tribute. As if he ſayd: If ye
haue ſo let in Ceſar, that his money is coyned with you, ſurely he
bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rule ouer you, as though he ſhould ſay: It is come to paſſe
through your owne fault that Ceſar ruleth ouer you. What ſhould they ſay
or doe vnto this queſtion? They merueiled and went their wayes, they thought
that they ſhould notably haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome him, but for all their ſubtiltie
and wiſedom they were deceiued.</p>
            <p>This is written for our comfort,<note place="margin">The wiſdom
&amp; ſtrength of Chriſtians</note> that we which are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may
know that we haue ſuch wiſedom, as exceedeth all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſuch
ſtrength and righteouſnes, as whereunto no ſtrength &amp; righteouſnes
of man is like. For againſt the holy Ghoſt there is no counſell: this
power and ſtrength we obtaine through Chriſt, that we may tread ſinne
vnder foote, and triumph ouer death. When Chriſt dwelleth in vs by faith, we
haue him which bringeth to paſſe ſuch thinges, howbeit they are not
throughly felt but in time of tentation. Wherefore when I ſtand in neede, he
is preſent, and giueth vnto me ſtrength, that I may courageou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
paſſe through. We muſt not therefore be afraide that our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſhall periſh and be put to ignominie and ſhame. For let all the wiſe
men of the world riſe againſt the worde of God, yea and be neuer ſo
circumſpect, and ſet them ſelues againſt it, yet ſhall they haue the
foyle and be ouercome. It may be that they barke and bite, ſo that it
ſeemeth vnto men, as though they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Goſpell, but when
they haue ſet them ſelues againſt it to extinguiſh it, they ſhall no
whit preuaile, but in the ſnare that they haue layd for others, they
themſelues ſhall at length be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. As we ſee here in this text, and
commonly in Paule, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the hiſtorie of S. Steuen, where we
read how vainely his aduerſaries vſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures, yea thoſe that they
vſed were againſt them ſelues. For the Iewes did accuſe Steuen, that he
had ſpoken both againſt the temple, and againſt God which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the
temple to be builded, bringing &amp; alleaging Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereby they
thought to conuince and condemne him. But Steuen being full of the holy
Ghoſt, ſhewed them in order out of the Scripture, how that God dwelleth not
in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples made with handes: Dauid would haue built him an houſe, but God
refuſed it. What was the cauſe hereof? A long time before Dauid was 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:9413:118"/> borne, God dwelt among his people. He ſurely ſhould
be a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable God which ſhould neede a houſe. And ſo he confirmeth by
many hiſtories that God doth not dwell in houſes or temples made with
handes. What ſhould the Iewes doe here? they did manifeſtly acknowledge
their owne Scripture, which they had brought againſt Steuen. So all they
ſhall be put to ſhame and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, which ſet them ſelues againſt
the wiſedom &amp; worde of God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhall
neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the
Goſpell.</note>Wherefore let no man be afraide, albeit all the wiſedom and
power of the world ſtriue againſt the Goſpell, although it would
extinguiſh it euen by ſheding of blood. For the more blood that is ſhed,
ſo much more is the number of Chriſtians increaſed. The blood of
Chriſtians ſayth Tertullian, is ſeede whereof Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans growe. Satan
muſt be drowned in the blood of Chriſtians. Wherefore it is not violence
and force that is able to ſuppreſſe the Goſpell: for it is like vnto a
palme tree, which hath this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and qualitie, that albeit a weight be layd
vpon it, yet it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes riſeth and lifteth vp it ſelfe againſt the
weight. Such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo hath the Goſpell, for the more it is ſtriuen
againſt, ſo much more are the rootes thereof ſpred abroade, and the more
mightely that it is oppreſſed, by ſo much doth it more and more grow and
increaſe. Wherefore there is no cauſe that we ſhould be afraid of
power,<note place="margin">Not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and trouble, but too much
proſperitie is to be feared of Chriſtians</note> but rather that we
ſhould feare proſperitie &amp; merie dayes, which are able to hurt vs more
then anguiſh &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. Neither let vs be afraid of the
ſubtiltie and wiſedom of the world, for they can not hurt vs, yea the more
that they ſtriue againſt the truth, ſo much more pure &amp; cleare is the
truth made. Nothing therefore can come better to the Goſpel, then when the
world with his force and wiſedom ſetteth it ſelfe againſt it. The more
vehemently ſinne and Satan doe fight againſt my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo much
ſtronger is my righteouſnes made. For if ſinnes do vrge and diſquiet
me, I doe then more ardently pray and cry vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and ſo my faith is more
and more increaſed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi>

a treaſure, which is increaſed and ſtrengthned by perſecutions and
aduerſitie, there is no cauſe that we ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, but rather that
we ſhould with a cheerefull mind reioyce in tribulation, as S. Paule ſayth

            <p>If the deuill were endued with ſuch wiſedom, that he would be
quiet, and ſuffer the Goſpell to haue free courſe, he ſhould not
ſuffer ſo much loſſe. For when the Goſpell is not impugned, it is as

haue written againſt vs, they haue thereby done nothing els, but as it were

venimous nature, that they neither can nor will vſe thoſe things to the
commoditie and profit of their neighbour: but truſting to their owne giftes
and abilitie, they hope that now they ſhall obtaine this, now that, neither
doe they thinke that they ſhall haue neede of Gods helpe alſo thereunto: As
it appeareth here in the Phariſees and Scribes, who were certaine, as they
ſuppoſed, that if they ſo ſet vpon the Lorde, it could not be, but that
they ſhould then entangle him. For it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, thought they, that
he ſhould here eſcape vs, we ſhal here hold him as it were falne into a

ſet forth. There is nothing els in man but wickednes, deluſion, guile,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, lying, fraude, and all kind of euill, yea of nature man is but lyes
and vanitie as the 116 Pſalme ſayth. We muſt not truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man in any
thinge, doe not perſwade thy ſelfe, that any man ſpeaketh the truth vnto
thee, for whatſoeuer man ſpeaketh it is a lye. Why ſo? The fountaine or
ſpringe head, that is, the hart is not ſincere, wherfore neither can the
riuers be pure. And for this cauſe the Lord doth commonly call men the
generation of vipers and broode of ſerpents. Is not this a goodly title of
man?</p>
            <p>Let any man nowe goe, and glory of his owne righteouſnes,
ſtrength or free will. Before the world in deede ſome man may be, and
gloriouſly appeare goodly, righteous, and holy, but there is nothing els, but
a generation of vipers and broode of ſerpents, and that eſpecially in
thoſe that ſeeme moſt excellent, moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, moſt wiſe, &amp;
of greateſt vnderſtanding. If thou go through euen all the hiſtories of
the Greekes, Iewes, &amp; Romanes, thou ſhalt find the beſt and wiſeſt
Princes of all, which haue gouerned the affayres of their Empire
proſperouſly, thou ſhalt find them I ſay to haue thought nothing of
God, but onely truſting to them ſelues, to haue acknowledged nothinge as
receiued from God. Hereupon it is gathered, that the leſſe a man excelleth
in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before the world, ſo much leſſe doth he commit againſt
God. For they that excell in counſell and authoritie before the ſight of
the world, doe for the moſt part deceiue and lye more then others. thinking,
that if they dealt by deluſions and deceit, their fraude &amp; iniquitie is
not perceiued: for they can after a prety ſorte cloke their craft and
ſubtiltie. But the holy Ghoſt hath a moſt cleare &amp; bright ſight,
which they can not auoyde, but they ſhall be eſpied. The Scripture doth
often times call ſuch, lyons, wolues, beares, ſwine, and cruell beaſtes,
inaſmuch as they rage, and deuoure and conſume all thinges with their
fraude and deceit. Wherefore in the old Teſtament the Iewes were forbidden to
eate of certaine beaſtes, as of thoſe already rehearſed, and of others,
for this one cauſe eſpecially, that it ſhould be a type and example to
vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might perceiue, that there are ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are ſtrong,
mighty, rich, witty, learned, ſkilfull, and wiſe, which are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
and eſchewed as a certaine vncleane thing, and as ſuch as 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:9413:119"/> ſeduce and deceiue others with their fayre ſhew,
might, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For neither ſhall they be counted for ſuch, neither
will any man thinke them to be ſuch, as doe ſo much as thinke any euill in
their hart, much leſſe doe it. Wherefore thou muſt put no truſt &amp;
confidence in any man, truſt not vnto him, for he will deceiue thee wherein
ſoeuer he is able. Againe if thou truſteſt man, thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,
in whom thou putteſt not thy truſt. It is written in the 17 chapter of
Ieremie: <hi>Curſed be the man that putteth his truſt in man,</hi> and,
<hi>Bleſſed is the man that putteth his truſt in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some man may now ſay: How ſhall we doe then?<note place="margin">An obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> One man muſt haue dealing with an other,
otherwiſe howe can the life of man continue? We muſt buy, we muſt ſell,
we muſt vtter and chaunge our wares with men: Now if one ſhould not truſt
an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the whole trade of mans affaires ſhould be in perill, yea and
periſh. I ſay that no man can deny,<note place="margin">The aunſwer</note>
but that there muſt be mutual dealings among men, and that one doth neede the
helpe and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of an other. But this I will haue, that whatſoeuer dealing
thou haſt with men, either in buying or ſelling, thou count it for a thinge
vncertaine, which thou muſt neither truſt, nor build vpon it. For this is
certaine, as ſoone as thou ſhalt truſt to man he will ſeeke to deceiue
thee, foraſmuch as the nature of man, as it is of it ſelfe, can doe nothing
but lye and deceiue. Yea all thinges in man are vncertaine, both his works and
words, there is nothing in him, but lightnes and vnconſtancie,<note place="margin">We muſt put all our hope and truſt in God onely.</note> which
thou mayſt boldly beleeue to be true. Wherefore all our hope and confidence
muſt be repoſed in God alone, and after this ſort we muſt ſay: Lorde,
giue thou me grace that I may direct &amp; order my life, my ſoule, my body,
my ſubſtance and goods, and whatſoeuer is mine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy diuine
will, for I beleeue in thee, I truſt in thee, doe not thou forſake me in
ſo perilous dealing with this or that man: I put no truſt in man. If thou
knoweſt that it is good for me, make him to deale faithfully with me: if thou
knoweſt that it will be to my hinderance and hurt, helpe me to auoid it, for
thy will onely pleaſeth me, which I wiſh alwayes to be done.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as thou thinkeſt in thy mind: He is a good man, and
one that wil keepe his promiſe, I am ſure that he wil not deceiue me, but
wil deale faithfully, euen then haſt thou fallen from God, and worſhipped
an idoll, putting thy truſt in a lyar. Wherefore <pb n="222" facs="tcp:9413:120"/> when
thou haſt any dealing with man, thinke boldly: If he deale faithfully, it is
well, if he doe otherwiſe, in the name of God, let him goe, I will commit all
thinges to the will of God, he ſhall proſperouſly bring them to
paſſe. Of ſuch a falſe and vngodly confidence repoſed in men,<note place="margin">How y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Saincts crept in amonge
Chriſtians.</note> that euill crept in among Chriſtians, namely the
worſhipping of Sainctes, whereby the Chriſtian Church, that is, the true
congregation of the faithfull, hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red exceeding great hurt and
incomparable ruine. For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the ſeruice and worſhipping of
Sainctes but a deuiliſh thing? When as men vſed to reaſon after this
ſorte: This man was very holy, that which he taught, he did, whom we wil
follow, and doe the like. Hierome, Auguſtine, Gregorie ſayd this,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it true, &amp; therefore will I beleeue it. Frauncis, Benedict,
Dominicke, Bartholomewe liued thus, they did this and that, I will imitate
their life and workes. Moreouer Auguſtine was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this rule,
wherefore I alſo ſhall be ſaued by it. Fy, howe vnſtable and
miſerable a thinge is this, they are onely lyes and dreames of men, there is
not in one word mention made here of Chriſt and his word, but they are onely
the vaine inuentions and trifles of men. I would vtterly breake the rule of
Auguſtine, if he therefore ordayned it, thinking to be ſaued thereby. So
blind and without vnderſtanding is reaſon, that it receiueth the dotages
&amp; vaine inuentions of men, when as notwithſtanding the worde of God onely
is to be receiued in matters of ſaluation, as if Herod, Pilate, Caiphas,
&amp; Hannas ſhould preach the Goſpell, I ought to receiue it. Againe, if
thoſe that are counted holy, ſhould riſe and preach lyes, alſo rules,
habits, ſhauings, ceremonies, and ſuch like vaine inuentions of men, I
ought in no wiſe to receiue them, for we muſt here haue reſpect, not to
the perſons, but to that which they preach.</p>
            <p>Dooſt thou preſume to be wiſer then all the fathers &amp;
ſaincts, then all the Biſhops and Princes of the whole worlde? Thus may
ſome man obiect againſt me. Farre be that from me. For I doe not contend to
be wiſer then they. But this without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie is thus, that
whatſoeuer is wiſe, great, liberall, mighty &amp; ſtrong before the
world, doth ſeldom or neuer agree with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. For ſo it falleth
out, that they that are ſuch doe for the moſt part perſecute the
Goſpel, and if they were not ſo great, the Goſpell ſhould not ſo
greatly ſhine forth and triumphe. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <pb n="223" facs="tcp:9413:120"/>
Emperours Hadrian, Traian, Diocletian were the moſt wiſe Ceſars of all,
whoſe gouernment was ſo liked of, that it was prayſed of the whole world,
yet they perſecuted the Goſpell, and could not abide the truth. The ſame
we find written of the Kings of the Iewes, as of Achas and others, which
gouerned their kingdom very well, yet deſpiſed the word of God and
diſobeyed his commaundements. We in our time had neuer ſuch Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours or
Princes, as are comparable to them. But it ought to be verified in theſe,
that God would by fooliſh preaching confound the wiſedom of this worlde, as
Paule ſayth 1. Cor. 1. All theſe thinges are ſhewed vnto vs in this text
which we haue in hand, which hath a ſimple and a ſclender ſhewe and
appearance of it ſelfe, but yet containeth many thinges in it moſt worthy
the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Now how the Lord concluded with the Phariſees, when they had
ſhewed him the tribute money, and had aunſwered that it was Ceſars image
and ſuperſcription, the Euangeliſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſaying:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giue therefore to Ceſar the things which are Ceſars, and
giue vnto God thoſe things which are Gods.</hi> Although they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
no ſuch thing of the Lorde,<note place="margin">The ſword and office of the
Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſt.</note> neuertheles he teacheth them the
right way. And in theſe wordes he confirmeth the ſword and office of the
Magiſtrate: they hoped that he would condemne &amp; reſiſt him, but he
doth nothing leſſe, for he commendeth and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, commaunding that
they giue vnto him thoſe thinges that are his. Whereby he plainly will haue,
that there be Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Princes, and Rulers, vnder whoſe gouernment we
muſt liue. Neither muſt we care whether they vſe and exerciſe their
rule and authoritie well or ill, we muſt haue regard onely to their power and
office, for their power &amp; authoritie is good inaſmuch as it is ordained
&amp; inſtituted of God. Neither is there any cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt
find fault with power, if at any time thou be oppreſſed by Princes and
tyrannes: for whereas they abuſe the power giuen vnto them of God, they
ſhall ſurely be compelled to giue an account thereof. The abuſe of a
thing doth not make that thing euill, which is in it ſelfe good. A chayne of
golde is good,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> neither is it therefore
made worſe, for that a harlot weareth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her neck, or if one ſhould
put out myne eye with it, ſhould I finde fault in the chayne therefore? In
like maner the power of the Prince muſt be borne, for if he abuſe his
office, he is not to be <pb n="224" facs="tcp:9413:121"/> counted of me as noe Prince,
neither belongeth it vnto me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge or puniſh it in him. I muſt obey
him for God his cauſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for he repreſenteth the place of God. How
grieuous thinges ſoeuer therefore Magiſtrates ſhall exact, I muſt for
God his cauſe beare them all, and obey them, ſo farre as they be not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods commaundements. If they doe iuſtly or vniuſtly, it
ſhall in due time appeare. Wherefore if thy ſubſtance, life and body, and
whatſoeuer thou haſt ſhould be taken from thee by the Magiſtrates, thou
mayſt ſay thus: I willingly yeeld them vnto you, and acknowledge you for
Rulers ouer me, I will obey you, but whether ye vſe your power and authoritie
well or ill, ſee you to that.</p>
            <p>Moreouer whereas Chriſt ſayth: <hi>Giue vnto Ceſar the
things that are Ceſars, and vnto God thoſe thinges that are Gods.</hi> We
muſt vnderſtand that vnto God pertaineth honour,<note place="margin">What
things muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto God, &amp; what vnto Ceſar.</note> we muſt
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for the liuing, omnipotent, and wiſe God, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
vnto him what good thing ſoeuer can be named. And albeit we doe not giue him
this honour, he notwithſtanding eaſily kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it, for nothing is either
added to, or taken from him by our honouring. Howbeit in vs he is true,
omnipotent, and wiſe, when as we count him ſo, and beleeue that he is
ſuch a one, as he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him ſelfe to be ſayd to be. Nowe vnto
Ceſar and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate feare, cuſtome, tribute, obedience, &amp;c: are
due. God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth eſpecially the hart, the Magiſtrate the body and goods,
ouer which he executeth his office in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of God, which S. Paule doth
moſt notably in plaine and manifeſt wordes declare Rom. 13: <hi>Let euery
ſoule be ſubiect vnto the higher powers: for there is no power but of God:
and the powers that be, are ordained of God. VVhoſoeuer therefore
reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: and they that
reſiſt, shall receiue to them ſelues condemnation. For Magiſtrates are
not to be feared for good workes, but for euill. VVilt thou then be without
feare of the power? doe well: ſo shalt thou haue prayſe of the ſame. For
he is the Miniſter of God for thy wealth, but if thou doe euill, feare: for
he beareth not the ſword for nought: for he is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God to take
vengeance on him that doth euill. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt be ſubiect, not
becauſe of wrath onely, but alſo for conſcience ſake. For, for this
cauſe ye pay alſo tribute: for they are Gods Miniſters, applying them
ſelues for the ſame thinge. <pb n="225" facs="tcp:9413:121"/> Giue to all men
therefore their dutie: tribute, to vvhom ye ovve tribute: cuſtome, to vvhom
cuſtome: feare, to vvhom feare: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to vvhom ye ovve honour.</hi> And
therefore alſo are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats ordayned of God, that they may defende &amp;
maintaine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace, which alone exceedeth all worldly good thinges: we
felt a litle in the laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion of the common people, what loſſe,
miſerie, calamitie and grieuous ſorrow conſpiracie and ſedition
bringeth in the world. God graunt that it may ſo continue, that we trie it no

righteouſnes. Whatſoeuer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minde ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, although it be holy,
although it haue a fayre ſhew before men, it muſt needes vtterly fal, if
that he wil haue ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to come thereby. For albeit that man is
exerciſed with the duties of godlines, he ſhall not be able to attaine vnto
heauen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les <pb n="227" facs="tcp:9413:122"/> God preuent him with his word, which may
offer his diuine grace vnto him, and lighten his hart, that he may walke in the
right way. Now this way is the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſt the right way.</note> he that will ſeeke an other way,
as the moſt part of men with their outward workes commonly doe, hath now
erred from the right and high way. For Paule ſayth Gal. 2: <hi>If
righteouſnes be by the law,</hi> that is, by the workes of the lawe, <hi>then
Chriſt died without a cauſe.</hi> Therefore I ſaye, that a man muſt by
the Goſpell be as it were bruſed and broken, &amp; humbled euen from the
bottom of his hart, as being fraile &amp; weake, which can moue neither hands
nor feete, but onely lyeth proſtrate and cryeth: Helpe me O omnipotent God,
merciful Father, I am not able to helpe my ſelfe: Helpe O Lord Chriſt, myne
owne helpe is nothing. That ſo againſt this corner ſtone which is
Chriſt al may be broken, as he ſaith of him ſelfe in Luke, when he
aſked the Phariſees and Scribes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi>
20.17.</note> 
                  <hi>VVhat meaneth this then that is written: The ſtone that the
builders refuſed, that is made the head of the corner? VVhoſoeuer shall
fall vpon that ſtone, shall be broken: &amp; on whomſoeuer it shall fall,
it wil grinde him to pouder.</hi> Wherefore either let vs fal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by our
imbecillitie and weakenes, by denying our ſelues, &amp; ſo be broken, or
els he will breake vs for euer in his ſtraite iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is better
that we fall vpon it, then that it fall vpon vs. Vpon this foundation Chriſt
ſayth here in this text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man can come vnto me, except the Father which hath ſent
me, draw him: and I will rayſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> Now he whom the
Father draweth not, ſhall ſurely periſh. It is alſo concluded that he
which commeth not to this ſonne, ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for euer. He is the onely
Sonne giuen vnto vs, which may ſaue vs, without him there is no ſaluation:
if he helpe not,<note place="margin">Without Chriſt there is no
ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> our caſe is moſt miſerable: Of him Peter alſo
ſpeaketh to the ſame effect in the Acts of the Apoſtles chap. 4: <hi>This
is the ſtone caſt aſide of you builders, which is become the head of the
corner, neither is there ſaluation in any other: for amonge men there is
giuen none other name vnder heauen, whereby vve muſt be ſaued.</hi> Whither
would our Diuines and Scholemen turne them ſelues here, which haue taught vs
that by many workes we muſt attaine vnto righteouſnes? Here is that high
Maiſter Ariſtotle confounded, who hath taught vs, that reaſon endeuoureth
to doe the beſt things, &amp; is alwayes ready to the better. But this
Chriſt <pb n="228" facs="tcp:9413:123"/> doth here deny: for vnles the Father
poſſeſſe and drawe vs, we ſhall periſh for euer. Here all men
muſt confeſſe their imbecillity and ſlownes to good thinges. If ſo be
that any perſwade him ſelf that he is able to doe any good thing by his
owne ſtrength, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath reproued Chriſt of falſhood, and with
great arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie preſumeth to come to heauen, albeit he is not drawn of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore where the word of God is in his courſe, &amp; ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preached, whatſoeuer thinges are high and great, it caſteth them downe, it
maketh all mountaines euen with the valleies, and ouerthroweth all hilles, as
the Prophet Eſai ſayth, that all harts hearing the worde may deſpeire of
them ſelues, otherwiſe they can not come vnto Chriſt. The workes of God
are ſuch, that while they kill, they make aliue, while they condemne, they
ſaue: as Hanna the mother of Samuel ſingeth of the Lord:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord killeth, and maketh
aliue, bringeth dovvne to the graue, &amp; fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vp againe. The Lord maketh
poore, &amp; maketh rich, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth lovv,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draweth vs vnto Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>and heaueth vp on hie.</hi>
Wherefore if a man be thus ſtriken of God in his hart, that he acknowledgeth
him ſelfe ſuch a one as ought for his ſinnes to be condemned, he ſurely
is euen that very man, whom God by his word hath ſtriken, and by this
ſtroke hath faſtened vpon him the bond of his diuine grace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he
draweth him, that he may prouide for his ſoule, &amp; haue care of him. He
could firſt find with him ſelfe no helpe nor counſel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he
wiſh for any, but now he hath found the ſpeciall conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation &amp;
promiſe of God, which is after this ſort: <hi>He that asketh receiueth, he
that ſeeketh findeth, &amp; to him that knocketh it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</hi> By
ſuch a promiſe man is more &amp; more lifted vp in mind, &amp; conceiueth a
greater truſt and confidence in God. For as ſoone as he heareth that this
is the worke of God alone, he deſireth of God, as at the hand of his
mercifull father, that he will vouchſafe to drawe him. If ſo be that he be
drawne of God vnto Chriſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutedly that alſo ſhall come vnto him,
whereof the Lord maketh mention here, namely that he wil raiſe him vp at the
laſt day. For he layeth hold on the word of God, &amp; truſteth in God,
whereby he hath a certaine teſtimony, that he is he, whom God hath drawne: As
Iohn ſayth in his firſt Epiſtle:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
5.10.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeueth in that Sonne of God hath the vvitnes in him
ſelfe.</hi> Hereupon it muſt needes follow, that he is taught of God, and
in verity now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God to be no other, but a helper, a comforter, and a
Sauiour. <pb n="229" facs="tcp:9413:123"/> Hereby it is now manifeſt, that if we
beleeue, God will be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward vs but a Sauiour, helper, and giuer of
all felicitie, who requireth and aſketh nothing of vs, but will onely giue
and offer vnto vs, as he him ſelf ſayth vnto Iſrael Pſal. 81: <hi>I am
God thy Lord, which brought thee out of the land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> open thy
mouth wide, &amp; I will fill it.</hi> Who would not loue ſuch a God, which
ſheweth him ſelf ſo gentle and louing vnto vs, and offereth ſo readily
his grace and goodnes?</p>
               <p>They ſhall not be able to eſcape the ſeuere and eternall
iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which do vnaduiſedly neglect ſo great grace, as the
Epiſtle to the Hebrues ſayth: If they that tranſgreſſed the lawe of
Moſes, eſcaped not vnpuniſhed, but dyed without mercy, howe much more
grieuouſly ſhal God puniſh them, which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of the Teſtament
as an vnholy thinge, and tread vnder foote the ſonne of God?<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</note> O howe diligent is Paule in all his
Epiſtles to teach how the knowledge of God may rightly be conceiued? O how
often doth he wiſh encreaſe in the knowledge of God? As if he would ſay:
If ye onely knew and vnderſtood what God is, ye ſhould then be ſafe. Then
ye would loue him, and do all thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are approued of him. Thus he ſayth
Coloſ. 1: <hi>VVe ceaſe not to pray for you, and to deſire that ye might
be fulfilled with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will, in all wiſedom, &amp; ſpiritual
vnderſtanding: that ye might walke vvorthy of the Lord, &amp; pleaſe him in
all things, being fruteful in al good works, &amp; increaſing in the
knowledge of God, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthened with al might through his glorious power, vnto
all patience, &amp; long ſuffering with ioyfulnes: giuing thanks vnto the
Father, which hath made vs meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the
Sainctes in light.</hi> And Pſal. 119 Dauid ſayth: <hi>Inſtruct me, &amp;
I will keepe thy lawe, yea I will obſerue it vvith my vvhole hart.</hi> And
thus ye haue out of the firſt ſentence of this text, that the knowledge of
God doth come from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. It is needeful that he lay the firſt ſtone
in our building, otherwiſe we ſhal labour in vaine. But that is done thus:
God ſendeth vnto vs Preachers, whom he hath taught, and prouideth that his
will be preached vnto vs. Firſt that all our life and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the law.</note> although it haue a fayre ſhew
&amp; be holy outwardly, is of no eſtimation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yea is abhorred and
lothed of him. And this is called the preaching of the law.<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell.</note> Afterward he maketh grace
to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto vs, to wit, that he will not haue vs vtterly condemned 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:9413:124"/> and caſt of, but that he will receiue vs in his
beloued ſonne, and not ſimply receiue vs, but alſo make vs heires in his
kingdom, yea and Lordes ouer all thinges which are in heauen and earth. This
nowe is called the preaching of grace or of the Goſpell. And all this is of
God, which rayſeth vp and ſendeth forth Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. This S. Paule
ſignifieth when he ſayth thus Rom. 10: <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing
by the word of God.</hi> This alſo the wordes of the Lorde meane here in the
Goſpell, when he ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is written in the Prophets: And they shall be all taught
of God. Euery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father,
commeth vnto me: Not that any man hath ſeene the Father, ſaue he which is
of God, he hath ſeene the Father.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we heare the firſt
preaching, that is the preaching of the law, howe we are condemned with all our
workes, then man ſigheth vnto God,<note place="margin">What the preaching of
the law worketh in man.</note> and knoweth not what to doe, his conſcience is
euill and fearefull, and except helpe ſhould come in time, he ſhoulde
deſpeire for euer. Wherefore the other preaching muſt not be long
differred, the Goſpell muſt be preached vnto him, and the way vnto Chriſt
muſt be ſhewed, whom God hath giuen vnto vs a Mediatour, that through him
alone we may be ſaued, by meere grace and mercy, without all our owne works
and merits. Then the hart is made ioyfull,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of
the Goſpel what it worketh in vs.</note> and haſteth vnto ſuch grace, as
the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hart runneth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water. Dauid had a notable feeling
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when he ſayd thus Pſal. 42: <hi>Like as the hart deſireth the
vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brookes, ſo longeth my ſoule after thee, O God: My ſoule
thirſteth for God, yea euen for the liuing God.</hi> When therefore a man
commeth to Chriſt, through the Goſpell, then heareth he the voyce of the
Lord Chriſt, which ſtrengthneth the knowledge that God hath taught him: to
wit, that God is nothing els but a Sauiour abounding with grace, who will be
fauorable and mercifull to all them, which call vpon him in this his Sonne.
Therefore the Lord ſayth moreouer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verely, verely I ſay vnto you, He that beleeueth in me,
hath euerlaſting life. I am that breade of life. Your Fathers did eate Manna
in the vvildernes, and are dead. This is that bread vvhich co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth dovvne from
heauen, that he vvhich eateth of it should not die. I am that liuing bread,
vvhich came dovvne from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: if any man eate of this bread, he shall liue
for euer: and the <pb n="231" facs="tcp:9413:124"/> bread that I vvill giue, is my flesh,
vvhich I vvill giue for the life of the vvorld.</hi> In theſe wordes the
ſoule findeth a table daintily furniſhed, whereby it may ſtake all
hunger. For it knoweth aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that he that ſpeaketh theſe wordes
can not lye. Wherefore if it commit it ſelfe confidently vnto him, and cleaue
to the word, it reſteth vpon him, and ſo departeth not from this goodly
table. This is that ſupper, to the preparing whereof the heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
killed his oxen and fatlings, and hath bidden vs all vnto it. The liuing breade
whereof the Lorde here maketh mention,<note place="margin">Chriſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bread, whereon we muſt feede by faith.</note> is Chriſt him ſelfe,
whereby we are ſo fedde. If we lay hold but of a morſell of this bread in
our harts, and keepe it, we ſhall be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for euer, neither can we
euer be plucked from God. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuch an eating is nothing els, but to
beleue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Chriſt, that he is made vnto vs of God, as Paule ſayth
1. Cor 1. wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſnes, ſanctification, and redemption. He that
eateth this meat, liueth for euer. Wherefore by and by after this text, when
the Iewes were at contention about theſe his wordes, he ſayth: <hi>Verely,
verely I ſay vnto you, Except ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and
drinke his blood, ye haue no life in you. VVhoſoeuer eateth my flesh, &amp;
drinketh my blood hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, &amp; I vvill rayſe him vp at the
laſt day.</hi> Manna which the fathers did eate in the deſert (as Chriſt
here ſayth) could not ſaue from death: but this bread maketh vs immortall.
If we beleeue in Chriſt, death ſhall not hurt vs any thing at all, yea
there is no more death. This the Lord meaneth by theſe wordes in an other
place, where he ſayth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes: <hi>Verely, verely I ſay vnto
you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.51.</note> 
                  <hi>if a man keepe my
word, he shall neuer ſee death:</hi> where it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he ſpeaketh
of the word of faith, and of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay that holy men die
notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">An obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> for Abraham &amp; the
holy Prophets are dead, as the Iewes ſayd vnto him. I aunſwere: The death
of Chriſtians is onely a ſleepe,<note place="margin">The aunſwer</note> as
the Scripture alſo commonly calleth it: for a Chriſtian taſteth &amp;
ſeeth no death, that is, he hath the feeling of no death. For this Sauiour
Chriſt Ieſus, in whom he beleeueth, hath ouercome death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> afterwards he
ſhoulde not feele or taſt it, but death is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him onely a paſſage
and gate to life, as Chriſt him ſelfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Ioh. 5: <hi>Verely,
verely I ſay vnto you, he that heareth my vvord, &amp; beleeueth in him that
ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, &amp; shall not come into condemnation, but
hath paſſed from death <pb n="232" facs="tcp:9413:125"/> to life.</hi> Wherefore the
life of a Chriſtian is merie, and on euery ſide repleniſhed with ioy, and
the yoke of Chriſt is eaſie &amp; ſweete. But that it ſemeth heauy and
grieuous vnto vs, this is the cauſe, for that the Father hath not yet drawne
vs: hereupon it commeth to paſſe that we take no pleaſure thereof,
neither is the Goſpell comfortable vnto vs. If ſo be that we would lay vp
the wordes of Chriſt well in our hart, they would be vnto vs an exceeding
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And thus ye haue heard howe we muſt feede on this breade which came
downe from heauen, that is, on the Lord Chriſt, to wit by faith, which we
then do when we beleeue in him, that he is our Sauiour.</p>
               <p>The whole chapter out of which this text is taken, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto vs nothing els but ſpirituall meat. For when the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude followed
Chriſt, that they might againe eate and drinke, which the Lord him ſelfe
ſignifieth, he taketh occaſion of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral meat which they ſought,
&amp; almoſt through the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaketh of ſpirituall meat, as
he ſayd: <hi>The wordes which I ſpeake are ſpirit and life.</hi> Wherby
he would ſignifie, that he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fed them, that they ſhould beleeue in
him: &amp; as they did eate the bodily meat, ſo they ought alſo to feede of
the ſpirituall. Here let vs weie and marke this, that the Lord doth ſo
gently and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly apply him ſelfe to vs, and offer him ſelfe in
ſuch gentle wordes, that it ought worthely to moue our hartes to beleeue in
him, to wit, that that bread, was therefore giuen for vs, inaſmuch as it was
behouefull that he ſhould taſt death and ſuffer helliſh paines: Alſo
ſhould beare ſinnes which he neuer had committed, as though he had
committed them, and had bene his owne: and he did alſo the ſame willingly
for our ſakes, and tooke vs as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters.<note place="margin">The will of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father.</note> This if we beleeue, we
doe the will of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, which is nothing els but to beleeue in
his Sonne, &amp; ſo be ſaued. As Chriſt him ſelfe ſayth a litle
before: <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that euery man which
ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, should haue euerlaſting life.</hi>
It now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeareth that he that hath faith doth the will of God, and
eateth of this heauenly bread. As Auguſtine ſayth: What dooſt thou
prepare thy mouth, beleeue, and thou haſt eaten. Of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſupper the whole new Teſtament ſpeaketh, but eſpecially in this place
of Iohn. The Sacrament of Chriſtes body &amp; blood is a certaine
teſtimonie and pledge of this true ſupper, whereby <pb n="233" facs="tcp:9413:125"/>
we ought to ſtrengthen our faith, and to be aſſured, that this body and
this blood, whereof we feede in the Sacrament, deliuereth vs from ſynne,
death, Satan, and all euell.</p>
               <p>But how may a man perceiue and know,<note place="margin">How a man
maye know whether he be called to this ſpirituall ſupper.</note> that he
alſo doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this heauenly bread, and is called to this
ſpirituall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? let him conſider the caſe in his owne heart, which
if he fynde ſo affected, that it doth as it were feele a ſweetenes in the
promiſe of God, and is vndoutedly perſwaded, that he is of the companie of
them which pertaine to his ſupper, he is aſſuredly ſuch a one in deede.
For as we belteue, ſo commeth it vnto vs. Such a man hath alſo by and by a
regard of his neighbour,<note place="margin">Charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde our neighbour the
frute of true faith.</note> and helpeth him as his brother, careth for him,
giueth vnto him, lendeth him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth him, briefly doth no otherwiſe to
him then he deſireth to be done vnto himſelfe. And all this proceedeth from
hence, for that the bountifullnes and goodnes of Chriſt hath repleniſhed
his heart with ſweetnes and loue, that it is a pleaſure and ioy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him
to do good to his neighbour, yea and he is grieued if there be none toward whom
he may be ſeruiceable. And beſide all this, he is tractable and lowly
towardes all men, he doth not eſteeme the temporall pleaſure and pride of
life, he iudgeth no man, he defameeh no man, he interpreteth all thinges in the
better part. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſeeth that the matter goeth not well with his
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as that he fainteth in faith, waxeth colde in loue, and that his
life is not on euerie ſide approueable, he prayeth for him, and is ſore
grieued if any commit any thinge againſt God and his neighbour. In a ſumme,
the roote and ſappe are ſound, for they are in a flouriſhing vine, to
wit, Chriſt, and therefore ſuch frutes come forth. But if any be voide of
faith, and not taught of God, ſuch a one doth not feede on this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
bread, neither bringeth forth theſe frutes. For where a right faith is not,
there ſuch frutes are alwayes wanting. And therefore S. Peter teacheth vs to
make our calling vnto ſaluation, ſure by good workes, where he ſpeaketh
properly of the workes of loue, namely, that we do good to our neighbour, and
be affected toward him, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our owne fleſh and blood. Thus much
ſhall ſuffize concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this text. Let vs call to God for his grace.</p>

two parts, into doctrine and exhortation, Rom. 12. Doctrine is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one
teacheth that which was not knowne before, whereby men <pb n="235" facs="tcp:9413:126"/>
are inſtructed &amp; come to vnderſtanding. Exhortation is, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
preacher moueth &amp; prouoketh vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is already knowne. Either is
neceſſarie to be done of him, who will chriſtianly perfourme the duty of
preaching, wherefore Paul doth verie earneſtly apply himſelfe to both, and
that his exhortation may be more effectuall, &amp; may more acceptably enter
into the mindes of them whom he hath purpoſed to exhort, he vſeth certaine
elegant and figuratiue ſpeches, and doth with an adorned maner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
allure their mindes vnto him. For the wordes, ſleepe, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, light,
waking, armour, workes, the day, the night, which he here vſeth, are all
ſpoken figuratiuely, by which other thinges are ſignified, then their
nature and proprietie doe beare: for he ſpeaketh not of the naturall night,
daye, darkenes, armour, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſleepe, &amp;c: but he reſembleth by
theſe naturall thinges a certaine likenes to our mynde, whereby he may more
forcibly prouoke and bring vs to thoſe ſpirituall thinges. As if he
ſaide, ye ſee how men to get the riches of the preſent time, which do
ſoone periſh, riſe early, and laying aſyde the workes of darkenes,
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie themſelues to the workes of the day, after the night is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and the day is come: with how much greater diligence ought we, ſhaking of our
ſleepe, to riſe early, and caſting awaye the workes which we did while it
was yet darke, to applie our ſelues now to thoſe workes which are agreable
to our light, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the night is now paſſed, and the daye of our
ſaluation hath appeared?</p>
            <p>By ſleepe he ſignifieth euel workes which are voide of
faith:<note place="margin">What the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the words, ſlepe, to
riſe, &amp;c.</note> for ſleepe is a worke properly meete for the night,
and that he meaneth thus, he ſufficiently declareth, when he by and by after
addeth: <hi>Let vs caſt awaye the workes of darkenes.</hi> So
contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to wake and to riſe ſignifie good workes which come of
faith. For as ſleepe pertaineth properly to the night, ſo to riſe is
properly agreable to the morning and daye. Whereupon it is ſayd 1. Theſſ.
5: <hi>Beloued brethren, ye are not in darkenes, but ye are all the children of
light and of the daye: we are not of the night, neither of darkenes, wherefore
let vs not ſleepe as do other, but let vs watch and be ſober. For they that
ſleepe, ſleepe in the night, and they that be dronken, are dronken in the
night. But let vs which are of the day, be ſober, putting on the breſt
plate of faith and loue, and the hope of ſaluation for an helmet. 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:9413:127"/> For God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which died for vs,
that whether we wake or ſleepe, we should liue togither with him.</hi> It is
ſufficiently manifeſt, that the Apoſtle doth not in theſe wordes forbid
vs the ſleepe of nature, neuertheles he draweth a ſimilitude from naturall
ſleepe and waking, to ſpirituall, that is, to a good and euell life. And to
be briefe, to riſe out of ſleepe is here the very ſame thing that the
Apoſtle writeth, Tit. 2: <hi>That grace of God, that bringeth ſaluation
vnto all men, hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; teacheth vs that we should denie vngodlynes
&amp; worldly luſtes, and that we should liue ſoberly and righteouſly,
and godly in this preſent world: looking for that bleſſed hope and
appearing of the glorie of that mightie God, and of our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> For that which he calleth in theſe wordes, to deny vngodlines
and worldly luſtes, he calleth in the text which we haue in hand, to ariſe
from ſleepe, and that which he termeth to liue ſoberly, and righteouſly,
and godly, that he calleth in our preſent text, to watch, and to put on the
armour of light, and whereas he ſayth: the grace of God that bringeth
ſaluation, hath appeared, that he calleth here the day and light, of which we
wil hereafter ſpeake more at large.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Naturall and ſpiritual ſlepe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither.</note>Now let vs ſee what likenes there is betweene naturall and
ſpirituall ſleepe. He that ſleepeth naturally, neither ſeeth, nor
feeleth any of thoſe good thinges that are in the world, but lieth among
thoſe thinges which are euen next adioyning vnto him, as it were dead,
ſeruing to no vſe, neither regarding any thing at all. For albeit he liue
in himſelfe, yet is he as dead to all other. Againe, in ſtede of true
thinges, he is in dreames wholy occupied with vaine images and formes of
thinges, which appeare true, and is ſo fooliſh that he embraceth thoſe
vaine formes, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to be true thinges. But when he waketh,
thoſe images do togither vaniſh awaye, and the man beginneth to be occupied
with true thinges. After the ſame maner almoſt it is, when one is as it
were ſwallowed vp of vngodlines, for he ſleepeth, and is like a dead man
before God, neither ſeeth he, neither feeleth any of the good thinges, which
are good thinges in deede, namely, thoſe ſpirituall good thinges, which are
promiſed &amp; offered him by the Goſpell, albeit they be iuſt by him.
For thoſe thinges are ſeene and felt by faith alone, otherwiſe they are
remoued from <pb n="237" facs="tcp:9413:127"/> all ſight and feeling. Wherefore as long
as by reaſon of the ſleep of his vnbeleefe, he can haue neither any regard
or ſenſe of true good thinges, which are verie neere him through the
Goſpell, he buſieth himſelfe with the falſe good thinges of this world,
as riches, promotions, and pleaſures, which being compared vnto eternall
life, vnto heauenly ioy, and that perfect ſaluation which commeth to the
godly, are altogither as dreames, and as thoſe vaine viſions compared to
naturall thinges, whereof they are onely repreſentations. But when man
awaketh, and hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued faith, all regard and deſire of thoſe falſe
good thinges of this preſent life vaniſheth awaye, and he acknowledgeth
that they are nothing els but meere vanitie and falſhood, euen as thoſe
viſions do quite fade away as ſoone as a man awaketh out of naturall
ſleepe. Hereof the 76. Pſalme ſpeaketh? <hi>They haue ſlept their
ſleepe, and they whoſe handes were mightie, haue found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And
Pſal. 73: <hi>Like as a dreame when one awaketh, ſo shalt thou make their
image to vanish out of the citie.</hi> And Eſay 29: <hi>As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hungrie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
dreameth that he is eating, &amp; yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he awaketh his ſoule is emptie: or
as when a thirſtie man drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he is drinking, and when he awaketh he
is yet faint, and his ſoule hath appetite: euen ſo shall the multitude of
all nations be, that fighteth againſt mount Sion.</hi> See how
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly and diſdainfully the Prophet ſpeaketh of the chiefe
power, riches, pleaſures and promotions of the world, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them to
dreames and moſt vaine viſions wherewith they which are aſleepe are
deluded. What other durſt ſay, that the good thinges, riches and power of
theſe Kings, Princes, and rich men, are nothing els but dreames, when as for
them men mingle earth with heauen, fyer with water, raging without meaſure
and ende in the world? But the cauſe hereof is, for that they yet ſleepe,
therefore they do yet ſee nothing hereof, as they want fayth, ſo alſo are
they deſtitute of this light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For now is our ſaluation neerer, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleued.</hi>
What meane theſe wordes? did we beleeue before,<note place="margin">The
promiſe of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by his Sonne.</note> and do we not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue now? Here we muſt call to minde that which Paul writeth Rom. 1: that
God promiſed the Goſpell by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, that all ſhould by him be ſaued,
according to that which was ſaid vnto Abraham Gen. 22: <hi>In thy ſeede
shal all the nations of the <pb n="238" facs="tcp:9413:128"/> earth be bleſſed.</hi>
This bleſſing promiſed to Abraham in his ſeede, is nothing els, but
grace and ſaluation in Chriſt offered to the whole world by the Goſpell,
which Paule ſo interpreteth Rom. 4. and Gal. 3. For Chriſt is that ſeede
of Abraham, that is, as he is man, his fleſh and blood, by whom and in whom
ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be bleſſed, as many as beleeue in him, and call vpon him. This
promiſe was afterward by the Prophets continually more and more declared and
preached, for they did all write of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, of the grace
which he ſhould bring, and of the Goſpell, which Peter alſo
witneſſeth Act. 4. This promiſe of God all the faithfull beleeued which
died before Chriſt was borne, who by this faith were ſaued, and obtained
ſaluation in Chriſt and through Chriſt. Hereunto Paul now had reſpect
when he ſaid: <hi>Our ſaluation is now neerer, then when we belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi>
For that which he ſaith is thus much in effect: We belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in time paſt
that the promiſe made vnto Abraham, ſhould be fulfilled, now is it
fulfilled, and thoſe thinges that we beleeued ſhould come to paſſe, are
now preſent: Chriſt is come, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is reuealed and publiſhed,
and the bleſſing which we looked for, is ſpred ouer the world, all
thinges which we taried for, and beleeued being promiſed, are come. And
hereby the Apoſtle ſignified the ſpirituall daye, whereof he ſpeaketh
afterward, which is properly the beginning and manifeſtation of the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whereof we will hereafter ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Now by this, that thoſe thinges which we beleeued ſhould be
fulfilled, are now fulfilled, our faith is not any whit made voide or
fruſtrate, but much more ſound and perfect. For as they of the olde time
before Chriſtes incarnation beleeued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God which ſhould be
fulfilled, ſo do we beleeue that the ſame is fulfilled,<note place="margin">The faith of them which liued before Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation &amp;
theirs which liue after it, all one in it ſelfe.</note> and the faith is
altogether the ſame in it ſelfe, but that our faith followed theirs, as the
fulfilling followeth alſo the promiſe. For either faith truſteth in the
ſeede of Abraham, that is in Chriſt, theirs before his incarnation, ours
after it. Wherefore he that ſhould at this day beleeue with the Iewes that
Chriſt is to come, ſhould make God a lyer, as though he had not yet
fulfilled his promiſe, which he hath fulfilled, and being fulfilled would
haue it publiſhed and preached. So alſo ſhould ſaluation be yet farre
from the beleeuers, which we ſhould looke for being as yet to come, in the
time that ſhall hereafter follow. <pb n="239" facs="tcp:9413:128"/> Of this double faith
Paul ſpeaketh Rom. 1: <hi>By the Goſpell righteouſnes, which God giueth,
is reuealed from faith to faith.</hi> What meaneth this, from faith to faith?
nothing els, but that albeit the faith of the Fathers and our faith is the
ſame, whereby it is beleeued in Chriſt either to come, or which hath
already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: yet the Goſpell doth lead from their faith to ours, ſo
that it is now neceſſarie not onely to beleeue the promiſe that was to be
fulfilled, but alſo that it is fulfilled, which it did not behoue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
and the other Fathers to beleeue, although they had the ſame Chriſt which
we haue. For there is one faith, one ſpirit, one Chriſt, one communion of
all Saincts, this difference one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is betweene vs, that they went before
Chriſt, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</p>
            <p>We haue therefore beleeued, and we do alſo beleeue, to wit the
Fathers and we, with a like and common faith in the ſame Chriſt, although
not after the ſame maner, as it is ſaide. And as by reaſon of this
communion of faith which we haue a like in the ſame Chriſt, we ſay: we
haue beleeued, or we did beleeue, when as not we, but the Fathers haue beleeued
or did beleeue: ſo they againe did ſay, that they ſhould heare, ſee,
and beleeue in Chriſt, when as not they, but we do liue in that time. We read
not in a few places of the Scriptures, that they which were before the
incarnation of Chriſt, tooke vpon them the perſon of them which are after
it, and they which are after it, of them which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, becauſe of
the communion of faith, and the ſame Chriſt, which they haue in common, and
ſo there is as it were one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of beleeuers. Now whereas the Apoſtle
ſaith,<note place="margin">How ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs then it was to
the beleuers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtes incarnation.</note> that ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now
neerer vnto vs then when we beleeued, that is, when our Fathers thoſe
auncient beleeuers did looke for it to come, we muſt not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it of
the neerenes of poſſeſſion, as though we now had it neerer and more
certainly then they, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had altogither the ſame faith, as it is
ſaid, and the ſame Chriſt, wherefore ſaluation was as neere vnto them
as vnto vs. For Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, the ſame alſo is for
euer. Heb. 13. Chriſt continueth the ſame from the beginning of the world
euen vnto the end, by whom all are ſaued alike. But Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the
neerenes of reuealing, that what ſoeuer thinges were ſaide before
concerning Chriſt, they were now fulfilles, death being ouercome, the Lord
did ſitte at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <pb n="240" facs="tcp:9413:129"/> the
Goſpell was preached abroad in the world, by which Chriſt did come vnto all
in the whole world, for this cauſe Paul ſayth that our ſaluation is
neerer then when it was hidden, and knowne vnto few men: becauſe that
Chriſt being not yet glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it was not meete that the preaching of
ſaluation ſhould be made publike or common.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore the Apoſtle ſayth here, <hi>Our ſaluation
is now neerer vs,</hi> he ſayth the ſame thing in the Epiſtle to Titus in
other wordes: <hi>The grace of God, which bringeth ſaluation, hath
appeared,</hi> that is, hath ſprong forth, and is euerie where commonly
preached: although it was not hid before in any of the Saincts,
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it was not yet commonly knowne vnto the world. After the
ſame ſort the Scripture ſpeaketh in many places, when it ſometime
ſaith that Chriſt is to come, ſometime, that he is come, although he
alwayes hath bin, and is in all the elect. Howbeit becauſe he had not before
his reſurrection come to all by publike preaching, the Scripture ſpeaketh
diuerſly of his comming. For becauſe of this publike preaching he came in
the fleſh, being made man, for his incarnation had not bin profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to
any,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> if the Goſpell had not thereupon bin preached, by which he
came into the whole world, and whereby it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, why he was made
man, whereby that bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Abraham, is now publiſhed, and
made common to all which by the Goſpell beleeue in Chriſt. Hereupon Paul
ſayth verie well, Rom. 1. that the Goſpel was promiſed of God, &amp;c. as
though he would ſay, although God hath promiſed euerie where in the
writinges of the Prophets his ſonne in the fleſh, yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all
that ſhould be done, that the Goſpell might be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched abroad in the
world, whereby he commeth ſpiritually to the myndes of the beleeuers, (which
comming onely bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and is farre to be preferred before that
comming in the fleſh, inaſmuch as it was done becauſe of this) I ſay
rather that God promiſed by the Prophets in the Scriptures the Goſpell
concerning his ſonne. For God conſidered the Goſpell and our faith in all
theſe thinges, for which he would alſo haue him to be made man, that the
Goſpel might be preached of him, that being made man, he hath ſaued vs by
his death, and that the ſaluation which he hath wrought, might go into the
whole world, and be made neere vnto all. Some haue taught fower comminges of 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9413:129"/> Chriſt, according to the fower ſundayes in Aduent as
they call it, but this comming of Chriſt by the Goſpell, which is moſt
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie of all, and of which all do depend, of which Paul here
ſpeaketh, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming I ſay, they could not ſee, inaſmuch as they are
ignoraunt, both what the Goſpell is, and to what end it was giuen. They
babbie many things of the comming of Chriſt, and neuertheles they driue him
further from themſelues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen is diſtaunt from the earth. For what
can Chriſt profit any man, which doth not poſſeſſe him by faith? or
how can any man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe him by faith, where the Goſpell is not
preached?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The night is paſſed and the day is at hand:</hi>
               <note place="margin">By the daye what is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> His meaning in effect is,
that ſaluation is at hand. For by the day Paule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the
Goſpell, namely, that it is that daye, whereby our hearts and mindes are
enlightned, therefore ſuch a day being ſprong, our ſaluation is certainly
at hand, that is, Chriſt and his grace promiſed in time paſt to Abraham,
hath ſhined forth by preaching in the whole world, giueth light vnto all men,
raiſeth all out of ſleepe, ſheweth true and eternall good things, wherein
we may be hereafter occupied,<note place="margin">What is here ment by the
night.</note> and may walke honeſtly in this day. Contrariwiſe, by the
night all doctrine is to be vnderſtood, which is not the Goſpell, beſide
which none can bring ſaluation. But if thou do a litle more exactly wey the
wordes, thou ſhalt ſee that Paule deſcribeth that part of the daye, which
is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable of all, and moſt full of all pleaſauntnes, namely the
ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and amiable morning, and the riſing of the ſunne. For it is the
morning when the night is gone and ended, and the daye is nowe come, whereupon
all thinges are meruelouſly cheered and recreated, the birdes ſing, other
lyuing creatures doe ſtirre vp with alacritie and ioyfulnes: men being as it
were made aliue againe, doe goe forth to their labours: all thinges, the daye
ſpringing, and the morning ſhining, are ſo affected, as though the world
were renued, and all thinges reſtored to life againe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in many places of the Scripture, the ioyfull,<note place="margin">The
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the morning.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, and
quickning preaching of the Goſpell is likened to the morning and the riſing
of the ſunne, as it is here of Paule who calleth the Goſpell the day
ſprinking or ariſing. Alſo Pſal. 110: <hi>In the daye of thy power
shall the people offer thee free will offeringes, of the wombe of the morning
shall the dewe of <pb n="242" facs="tcp:9413:130"/> thy children ſpring.</hi> Here
alſo the Goſpell is plainly called the wombe of the morning, and the daye
of the power of Chriſt, wherein we are conceiued and borne the children of
God as deaw, to wit, without the labour of men, by the onely grace of the holy
Ghoſt from heauen. The moſt pleaſaunt and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſunne Ieſus
Chriſt maketh this daye, whom the Scripture hereupon calleth the ſunne of
righteouſnes.<note place="margin">Chriſt the ſunne of
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> God ſayth Mala. 4: <hi>To you that feare my name,
shall that ſunne of righteouſnes ariſe, and helth shalbe vnder this
winges.</hi> For as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, do receiue of him the beames
of his grace and righteouſnes, and doe obtaine ſaluation vnder his winges.
Whereupon it is ſaide Pſal. 118: <hi>This is the daye which the Lord hath
made, we will reioyce and be glad in it,</hi> as though he ſaide: This
corporall ſunne maketh the corporall daye, but God himſelfe maketh this
daye, euen he is that ſunne, from whence thoſe beames and that daye come,
wherewith the whole world is enlightned. Finally, hereupon he calleth
himſelfe the light of the world, Ioh. 9. And Pſal. 19: <hi>The heauens
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glorie of God,</hi> that is, euen as theſe bodily heauens do
bring the ſunne and the day, and the ſunne is caried in them, ſo the
Apoſtles haue in themſelues, and bring by preaching, the true ſunne,
which is Chriſt, &amp;c: Whereupon it followeth: <hi>In the heauens he hath
ſet a tabernacle for the ſunne, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth as a bridegrome out of
his chamber, and reioiceth as a giant to runne his courſe. His ſetting
forth is from the vtmoſt part of heauen, and his circuit vnto the vtmoſt
part thereof: and there is nothing hid from his heat.</hi> All this is ſaid
of the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pleaſaunt beginning or riſing of this day, that is of the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which the Scripture euery where meruelouſly ſetteth forth. For
it is a word which quickneth, maketh glad, willing, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ready to
do good workes, and finally it bringeth with it all good thinges. Wherefore it
is called the Goſpell or glad tydinges, for that it is a pleaſaunt, and
proſperous meſſage of the grace of God, and of all good thinges.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Goſpell reuealeth vnto vs all thinges
that are needfull for vs to know.</note>But who is able to rehearſe all
thoſe thinges, which this day reuealeth &amp; maketh manifeſt vnto vs? For
it teacheth all things, what God is, what we are, whatſoeuer is paſt, and
to come, of heauen, hell, the earth, Angels and Deuels. By this lampe is
ſhewed vnto vs, how we ought to behaue our ſelues in all theſe 
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:9413:130"/> thinges, and toward all, from whence we are, and whither
we go. Yet neuertheles Satan hath deceiued vs miſerable creatures, that
neglecting ſuch a day, whereby all thinges might be cleere and manifeſt
vnto vs, we ſeeke the truth of Philoſophers and heathen men, who haue not
ſo much as by a dreame knowne any whit of theſe thinges, and ſo we haue
ſuffered our ſelues to be blynded with mens traditions, and to be thruſt
backe againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the night. For it is not light, whatſoeuer is not this
day, otherwiſe Paul and the whole Scripture ſhould in vaine extoll this day
alone, and call all other beſide it the night. Surely the burden of Gods
diſpleaſure muſt needes be moſt grieuous, for that contrarie to ſo
plaine and manifeſt places of Scripture, we haue ſought an other light,
although the Lord himſelfe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe the light and ſunne of the
worlde. And if other proofes were wantinge, this one is ſufficient, that
vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe ſo impudently both ſet vp and glorie of Ariſtotle as
a light vnto them, in whom they exerciſe themſelues much more then in
Chriſt, yea nothing in Chriſt, but altogither in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let vs therefore caſt awaye the workes of darkenes, and let
vs put on the armour of light.</hi> As Chriſt is the ſunne,<note place="margin">By light is here ſignified and ment faith.</note> and the
Goſpell the daye, ſo fayth is the light whereby to ſee and watch in this
daye. For it would not profit, albeit the ſunne did ſhine, and make the
day, if the eyes did not perceiue the light. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although the Goſpell
be begon and preached in the whole world, yet none are lightened, but they that
receiue it, and by fayth being made capable of the light, doe ariſe out of
ſleepe. But to them that as yet ſleepe this ſunne and daye bring no
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, of which they receiue no light, no more then if no ſunne or daye
had ſhined. And this is that ſeaſon and hower, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpeaketh:
<hi>VVelbeloued brethren, foraſmuch as we know this, that it is now time that
vve should ariſe out of ſleepe, &amp;c.</hi> It is a ſpirituall time and
ſeaſon, although begun in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward time, as it doth daily alſo come,
wherein we ought to ariſe out of ſleepe, and lay aſide the workes of
darkenes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Paule ſheweth that he doth not ſpeake to them, which are
yet voide of fayth: for as it is ſaide, he teacheth not faith here, but the
workes and frutes of fayth, when as he ſaith: We know that the time is come,
and that the night being paſſed, the daye <pb n="244" facs="tcp:9413:131"/> is at
hand: they which beleeue not can not know theſe thinges. Now if thou obiect
and ſaye, what reaſon or cauſe is there that he ſhould write theſe
thinges to the faithfull, inaſmuch as they know that it is time? &amp;c. Thou
muſt call to mynde that in the beginning of the expoſition of this text of
the Apoſtle, we haue ſaide that the office of preaching is of two ſortes,
one of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,<note place="margin">We haue neede of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> an other of exhorting and mouing. Now a man can not
attaine vnto that knowledge, that it ſhould not be needefull that he be
alwayes moued, and kept in a continuall and freſh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of thoſe
thinges which he hath learned, leaſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the world, and the fleſhe
(which are enemies that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer graunt truce, neither ſlacke their
aſſault) doe make him wearie and ſlouthfull, that he maye at the laſt
ſleepe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altogither negligent in good thinges. For the deuell,
ſayth Peter, is ſuch an enemie, as goeth about continually like a roring
Lion, ſeeking whom he maye deuoure: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayth: <hi>VVatch and be
ſober.</hi> Paule alſo will haue vs doe the ſame thinge here. For
ſeeinge that the Deuell, the fleſhe, and the worlde keepe no meane, nor
make no ende of fightinge againſt vs, neither muſt there be any meane kept
or ende made of exhortinge, prouokinge, and mouinge vs to watche and worke.
Hereupon the holie Ghoſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an exhorter, inaſmuch as he inuiteth
and moueth vs vnto good.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Paule calleth the workes of light ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and
why.</note>For the ſame cauſe Paul alſo vſeth here choſen wordes: the
workes of darkenes he calleth not armour, but the workes of light he calleth
armour, not workes: vndoutedly that he might ſhewe, that there is a fight,
that labour and trauell is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that it can not be obtained without
perill, to watche and liue well, foraſmuch as ſo mightie enemies, the
deuell, the fleſh, and the world do without ceaſſing fight againſt vs,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iob ſayth chapter 7: <hi>The life of man vpon earth is a fight and
tentation.</hi> Nowe it is not a ſmall matter to ſtand all our life long in
the battaill, wherefore there is neede of verie ſhrill trumpets and warlike
drummes, that is of earneſt admonitions and exhortations, whereby we maye be
ſtirred vp and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to perſeuer valliauntly in the fight. Hereupon
nowe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, why he calleth good workes armour or weapons, and calleth
not the workes of darkenes ſo, which notwithſtanding, <pb n="245" facs="tcp:9413:131"/> if we conſent vnto them are alſo weapons, Rom. 6: <hi>Giue not
your members as weapons of vnrighteouſnes.</hi> Againe, it is before ſaide,
that by light is here ſignified faith, which from the daye of the Goſpell
by the ſunne Chriſt,<note place="margin">The armour of light what it
is.</note> ſhineth into our heartes, and enlightneth them, therefore the
armour or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of light are nothing elſe but the workes of this fayth.
Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trariwiſe, darkenes is infidelitie or vnbeleefe, which is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of
the abſence of the Goſpell as of the daye, and of Chriſt as of the
ſunne. This darkenes the deuell doth rule, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the doctrine
of men, and the iudgement of mans owne reaſon: wherefore the workes of
darkenes,<note place="margin">The workes of darkenes what they are.</note> are
the workes of infidelitie. For as Chriſt is the Lord and gouerner of the
light, which we ſaide to be fayth: ſo Paule Epheſ. 6. calleth Satan the
prince of darkenes, that is, of them which are without faith, and refuſe to
be obedient to God, as the ſame Apoſtle witneſſeth 2. Corinth. 4:
<hi>If our Goſpell be then hyd, it is hyd to them that are loſt, in whom
the god of this world</hi> (namely the deuell) <hi>hath blynded the myndes,
that is, of the infidels, that the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt
should not shine vnto them.</hi> But what both this armour or weapons of light,
and workes of darkenes are, it is now taught of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let vs walke honeſtly as in the day.</hi> No man worketh
thoſe things in the day, which he is wont to worke in darkenes, euerie one
feareth an other, and endeuoureth himſelfe to liue honeſtly. It is commonly
ſayd: The night is void of ſhame, which is true, and therefore men doe
thoſe thinges in the night, which they would be aſhamed to do in the daye,
but the daye is notwithout ſhame, and requireth an honeſt conuerſation.
After the ſame ſort ought a Chriſtian life to be:<note place="margin">The
life of a Chriſtian.</note> a Chriſtian ought to commit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whereof
he may be aſhamed, although the whole world ſhould ſee his workes &amp;
doinges. For he that liueth and worketh ſo, that he is vnwilling that all his
workes and doinges ſhould be ſeene and heard of all men, and his whole life
be manifeſtly knowne vnto all, liueth a liue vnworthie of Chriſt, according
to that which our Sauiour himſelfe ſayth Ioh. 3: <hi>Euerie man that doth
euell, hateth the light, neither commeth to light, leaſt his deedes should be
reproued. But he that doth truth, commeth to the light, that his deedes might
be made manifeſt, that they are wrought according to God.</hi> Hereby it
appeareth how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie <pb n="246" facs="tcp:9413:132"/> it is, that we ſhould be
prouoked and exhorted to watch and to put on the armour of light. For what one
is there at this day among Chriſtians, which can abide, that all his workes
ſhould be publiſhed openly in the light. Now what a Chriſtian life is
this, how hypocritically do we liue, when as we can not ſuffer our life ſo
much as to be diſcloſed before men, which now is diſcloſed before God
and all his Angels, and in the laſt day ſhalbe diſcloſed before all
creatures? Wherefore it behoueth a Chriſtian to liue ſo, as he deſireth
to appeare in the laſt day, and before all.<note place="margin">Eph.
5.8.9.</note> Hereupon Paul ſaith: <hi>Walke as the children of light: the
frute of the Spirit is goodnes, and righteouſnes, and truth.</hi> And Rom.
12: <hi>Procure thinges honeſt, not onely in the ſight of God, but alſo
in the ſight of all men.</hi> And 2. Cor. 1: <hi>Our reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is this, the
teſtimonie of our conſcience, that in ſimplicitie and godly purches, and
not in fleshly wiſedome, but by the grace of God we haue had our
conuerſation in the world.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſuch a life ſhall nothing at all
appeare, where faith is not, but where a liuely, a cheerefull and a ſtrong
faith is, there ſuch a life can not be wanting, foraſmuch as ſuch a faith
is not wearied, with well doing,<note place="margin">Preaching &amp; exhortation
neceſſary for them that do already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</note> neither ſleepeth.
Wherefore it is no leſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, to preach to them that haue
receiued the doctrine of faith, whereby they maye be prouoked and ſtirred vp
to go on in the good life which they haue embraced, and that they ſuffer not
themſelues to be ouercome by the aſſaults of the raging fleſh, the
craftie world, and moſt ſuttle Satan, then it is meete that the doctrine of
faith be preached to them that be as yet ignorant of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not in gluttonie and drunkennes, neither in chambering and
wantonnes, nor in ſtrife and enuying.</hi> Here he rehearſeth the workes of
darkenes by name, one of which he named alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, ſleepe,
according to that ſaying 1. Theſſal. 5: <hi>Let vs not ſleepe as do
other, but let vs watch and be ſober.</hi> Not that he forbiddeth naturall
ſleepe, but ſpirituall, which is infidelitie, whereof thoſe workes of the
fleſh proceede: howbeit naturall ſleepe alſo is a worke of darkenes, if
it be vſed for pleaſure, and through immoderate filling of the belly,<note place="margin">Paule by ſix workes of darkenes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the
reſt.</note> ſo that it is a hinderance to the light, that is, faith, and
to the armour thereof. Moreouer theſe ſix workes of darkenes which he here
rehearſeth, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the reſt. For Gal. 5. and Coloſſ. 3. he
reckneth vp <pb n="247" facs="tcp:9413:132"/> moe of them. But we wil diuide thoſe,
which he here rehearſeth, into two ſides, the right and the left. On the
right ſide theſe fower fight with the ſpirit, gluttonie, drunkennes,
chambering and wantonnes: on the left ſyde (foraſmuch as the left ſyde in
the Scriptures ſignifieth aduerſitie) thoſe thinges which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from
thence do fight, as are wrath, contention and ſuch like: but the right ſyde
ſignifieth proſperitie, and thoſe thinges which enſue thereof, as
delightes, gluttonie, drunkennes, and ouermuch ſleepe, &amp;c. Now it is
ſufficiently manifeſt, that Paul vnder two workes of darkenes here
rehearſed, namely, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enuying, doth comprehend the reſt alſo
of that ſort, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which are bitternes, anger, wrath, crying, and euell
ſpeaking. Ephe. 4. And thoſe which he rehearſeth in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the
Galathians: Hatred, debate, emulations, ſeditions, hereſies, murthers,
&amp;c. In a ſumme, hereunto pertaine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer come of euell anger,
either in wordes or deedes, all which can not be numbred. After the ſame
ſort vnder thoſe fower, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, drunkennes, chambering and wantonnes,
he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the vices of luſt, which are wont to be committed as well
in wordes as workes, which alſo no man is able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And ſo the
preſent wordes of the Apoſtle doe ſhewe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needeth it any further
declaration, that by theſe ſix workes all thinges are to be vnderſtood,
whereby they that are voyd of fayth, and are yet in darkenes, doe liue vnpurely
as concerning themſelues, and vniuſtly toward their neighbours, whoſe
whole life is diſordered and out courſe both toward themſelues and
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward other. For there is no man that knoweth not what it is to be gluttonous
and dronken, that is, either to eate or drinke aboue a meaſure neceſſarie
for the body, it is as well knowne, what it is to ſleepe in chambers, and to
be wanton, that is, to follow the pleaſure of the body, both with ſleeping
aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and with other lewd and vnchaſt geſtures and workes,
which are wont to be committed in chambers of full fedde, well tipled, idle and
ſlouthfull bellies, as well in the daye, as in the night, as well when they
are alone, as in the reſort and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of others. All which thinges do
require euen naturall darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſecret places, and are ſignified of
Paule by chambering and wantonnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But put ye on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> In theſe
wordes as it <pb n="248" facs="tcp:9413:133"/> were in a ſumme, he ſheweth all the
armour of light, when as he exhorteth vs to put on Chriſt.<note place="margin">Chriſt is put on two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</note> Now Chriſt is put
on of vs after two ſortes: firſt when we are clothed with his
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which is done by fayth, wherewith he that is endued,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth that Chriſt for him died, and fulfilled all thinges. For not ours,
but Chriſtes righteouſnes hath reconciled vs to the Father, and deliuered
vs from ſynnes. And ſo to put on Chriſt pertaineth to the doctrine of
faith, which teacheth that Chriſt was giuen vnto vs, and is vnto vs in
ſtede of a pledge. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Paule ſpeaketh Galat. 3: <hi>All ye that are
baptized into Chriſt, haue put on Chriſt.</hi> The other maner of putting
on Chriſt is, when we wey and conſider, that he is giuen vnto vs alſo in
ſteede of an example, that we ſhould ſhewe our ſelues ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable
toward our neighbours, being endued with the ſame vertues, with which we by
fayth acknowledge that he being adorned, did ſerue vs, that ſo we may
reſemble him in all points: and of this maner of putting on Chriſt Paule
ſpeaketh here. The ſame alſo he willeth vs to doe 1. Corinth. 15. when he
ſaith: <hi>As we haue borne the image of the earthly, ſo let vs now beare
the image of the heauenly.</hi> And Epheſ. 4: <hi>Caſt ye of, concerning
the conuerſation in time paſt, that olde man, which is corrupt through the
deceiuable luſtes, and be renewed in the ſpirit of your mynde, and put on
the new man, which after God is created vnto righteouſnes, and true
holines.</hi> Now in Chriſt we ſee nothing but the armour of light, no
glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, no drunkennes, but faſting, temperancie, keeping vnder of the
fleſh by diuers labours, traueling, preaching, praying, and doing well to all
men, in him was no place for ſlouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or ſuperfluous ſleepe, much
leſſe for wantonnes, but a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous chaſtitie and puritie: he
accuſtomed himſelfe to watche, to riſe early, to lye on the ground in the
field, hauing neither houſe, neither chamber, nor bedde: in him was noe
wrath, contention or brauling, but altogether goodnes, ſweetnes, meekenes,
charitie, mercy, patience, &amp;c. Wherefore where as Paule ſayth here
briefly: <hi>Put ye on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> it is as much as that we
ſhould ſet him before vs as an example to follow.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.12.</note>He teacheth the
Coloſſians the ſame thing in ſomewhat more wordes after this ſort:
<hi>Now therefore as the elect of God holy <pb n="249" facs="tcp:9413:133"/> and beloued,
put on the bowells of mercie, kindnes, humblenes of minde, meekenes, long
ſuffering: forbearing one an other &amp; forgiuing one an other, if any man
haue a quarrell to an other: euen as Chriſt forgaue, euen ſo doe ye. And
aboue all theſe thinges put on loue which is the bond of perfectnes: and let
the peace of God rule in your harts, to the which ye are called in one body,
and be ye thankefull.</hi> And Philip. 2, after that he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to
loue one an other, and that euery man ſhoulde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme other better then
him ſelfe, and ſeeke to pleaſure &amp; do for other, he alſo ſetteth
Chriſt before them as an example, who ſhewed him ſelfe to vs our
ſeruaunt, &amp; ſayth: <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you that was euen in
Chriſt Ieſus, who being in the forme of God thought it no robberie to be
equall with God: But he made him ſelfe of no reputation, and tooke on him the
forme of a ſeruaunt, and was made like vnto men, &amp; was found in shape as
a man.</hi> The ſumme therefore is this:<note place="margin">The armour of
light.</note> the armour or weapons of light are good workes, contrary to
thoſe workes of darkenes, gluttonie, drunkennes, chambering, wantonnes,
contention, and enuying, ſuch workes are, to faſt, to watch to pray, to
labour, to ſuffer hunger, thirſt, colde, heat, to be chaſt, to vſe
modeſtie, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie, goodnes, and that I doe not thruſt in too many of
myne owne wordes, let vs heare Paule him ſelfe rehearſing them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Gal. 5: <hi>The frute of the ſpirit is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
gentlenes, goodnes, faith, meekenes, temperancie.</hi> But he rehearſeth them
farre more at large 2. Cor. 6, ſaying: <hi>VVe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that ye receiue
not the grace of God in vaine: for he ſayth, I haue heard thee in a time
accepted, and in the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation haue I ſuccoured thee: behold nowe
the accepted time, behold now the day of ſaluation,</hi> as if he ſayd: Our
ſaluation is now nearer vnto vs then when we beleeued, to wit, that it would
come to paſſe, that theſe dayes of ſaluation, in which the Goſpell is
preached abroad to the whole worlde, ſhoulde appeare. It is time therefore to
ariſe out of ſleepe: <hi>Let vs giue no occaſion of offence in any
thinge, that our miniſterie be not reprehended. But in all thinges, let vs
approue our ſelues as the Miniſters of God, in much patience, in
afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in
priſons, in tumults, in labours: by watchings, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, by puritie, by
knowledge, by long ſuffering, by kindnes, by the holy Ghoſt, by loue
vnfeyned: By the word of truth, by <pb n="250" facs="tcp:9413:134"/> the power of God, by
the armour of righteouſnes on the right hand and on the left, By honour, and
dishonour, by euill report and good report, as deceiuers, and yet true: as
vnknowne, and yet knowne: as dying, and behold we liue: as chaſtened, and yet
not killed: as ſorrowing, and yet alway reioycing: as poore, and yet making
many rich: as hauing nothing, and yet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all thinges.</hi> See
what a plentifull and very golden ſtreame floweth out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of Paule.
Hereof I think we moſt plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, what is the armour of light,
wherewith we muſt be fenced and fortified both on the right hand, and on the
left.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for
all Chriſtians to follow.</note>Now this moſt fitly agreeth with the
matter, whereas he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before vs a moſt excellent and perfect example,
namely the Lord him ſelfe, ſaying: <hi>Put ye on the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> For he is a ſluggiſh beaſt and not a man, who when he
ſeeth his Lorde faſt, ſuffer hunger, labour, watch and to be wearie, yet
giueth him ſelfe to gluttonie, ſleepe, and pleaſures. What Lorde could
take theſe things at his ſeruaunts hand, nay what ſeruaunt durſt
preſume to doe theſe thinges? So it can not be that a Chriſtian man
ſhould not be aſhamed, when he beholdeth Chriſt, and ſeeth him ſelf
ſo vnlike vnto him, yea occupied in quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary things. For whom the
example of Chriſt him ſelfe doth not ſtirre vp, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and moue, who
can bringe or ſtirre him vp vnto goodnes? What would the leaues of wordes doe
with their ſmall noyce, if theſe thundrings of the example of Chriſt doe
not moue? And ſurely for this cauſe Paule of purpoſe adioyned this word,
<hi>Lord,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Put ye on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as if he
ſayd: count it no great nor burdenous thinge, to ſtand and fight in this
armour of light, ye that are ſeruaunts, behold your Lord, who when he had no
neede, did notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſo wel &amp; valiantly vſe this armour, and
fought in it for you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And take no thought for the flesh, to fulfill the luſts of
it.</hi> The Apoſtle in theſe few words hath noted two cares of the
fleſh: One is naturall,<note place="margin">Lawfull care for the
fleſh.</note> whereby neceſſary foode and apparell is prouided for the
body, that it may liue, and be able to ſuſtaine his labour, leſt that it
be by ouermuch abſtinence weakened, and made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to worke.<note place="margin">Vnlawfull prouiſion &amp; care for the fleſh.</note> The other
care is ioyned with ſinne, when the body is prouided for to fulfill the
luſtes thereof, and that it may be delighted: this care the Apoſtle here
forbiddeth, for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth the workes of darkenes, ſo to pamper and make
of the <pb n="251" facs="tcp:9413:134"/> fleſh, which is continually to be
chaſtiſed, that it may be obedient to the ſpirit, and may not ſhake of
the ſitter, like vnto an vntamed horſe, albeit that chaſtiſing is ſo
to be tempered, that the body notwithſtanding may doe his dutie, and beare
the ſitter. For as the fodder, the whippe and the burden belongeth vnto the
aſſe: ſo meat, correction, and worke vnto the ſeruaunt.
Eccleſiaſtic. 33. He doth not ſay that thou ſhalt flea or ſlay the
aſſe, neither that thou ſhalt kill the ſeruaunt, or caſt him into
priſon: ſo vnto the body the chaſtiſing and labour thereof is due, and
neceſſary foode is not to be withheld from it. Paule him ſelfe
ſayth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>I tame my body,
and bringe it into ſubiection.</hi> He ſayth not, I caſt it into
ſicknes, or I kill it, but I ſubdue it to the ſpirit, that it may
ſerue, and be obedient thereunto.</p>
            <p>Moreouer theſe wordes, <hi>to fulfil the luſtes thereof,</hi>
Paule ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe of two ſortes of men, whereof the firſt vnder a
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of naturall neceſſitie, doe ſatisfie their pleaſure,<note place="margin">We are prone and ready to fulfill the luſtes of the
fleſh.</note> and couer that practize vnder this falſe pretence. We are
ſo prone and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vnto this, that euen many of the Sainctes haue very much
complayned of this euil, and becauſe of it, haue oftentimes aboue meaſure
afflicted their bodies: for the fleſh is ſo craftie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous ſutle
to prepare delights for it ſelfe, that no man can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heede
of it, yea it is needefull that a man here doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue to care and feare.
The other ſort of men are thoſe blind holy ones, which thinke that the
kingdom of God and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes thereof conſiſteth in meates and
drinke, and in choſen apparell, and doe beſide their owne worke regard
nothing: when they haue ſo faſted, that they haue made their head

<hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.</note> and doe bring vnto their body ſome great infirmitie
or ſicknes, they then thinke that they haue bene meruelous holy, and haue
wrought incomparable good workes. But Paule ſayth: <hi>Meat maketh not vs
acceptable to God, for neither if we eate, haue we the more neither if we eate
not, haue we the leſſe.</hi> And Coloſ. 2. he writeth thus much in
effect: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the worſhipping of Angells, which hath a ſhew of
wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom becauſe of humblenes and ſuperſtition, whereby they ſpare
not the body, while they withdraw from it the meaſure of foode due vnto it,
beſtowing nothing vpon it whereby it may be fedde. This prepoſterous
worſhipping of Angells, yea in deede ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, did ſo deceiue
Gerſon, otherwiſe a notable man, that he <pb n="252" facs="tcp:9413:135"/> prayſed
the Charterhouſe Monkes, for that they did ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſtaine from
fleſh, that euen when they were ſicke they would eate none, although they
might preſerue them ſelues euen from death thereby. But what, if God
ſhall iudge them as killers of their owne body? For there can be none at all
either ordinaunce or order, yea or vow contrary to the commaundement of God,
&amp; if there be any ſuch, ſurely it ought to be of no force, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if
thou haddeſt vowed adulterie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Neceſſary prouiſion muſt be made for
the body.</note>Now God both here by Paule, and elswhere hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that
neceſſary prouiſion ſhould be made for the body, and hath forbidden
that we ſhould procure the death of it: wherefore thoſe thinges that are
profitable to preſerue it, whether they be fleſh or egges, or any thing
elſe, muſt be giuen vnto it, in what day or time ſoeuer, whether it be
the ſixt or firſt day of the weeke, whether it be Lent or after Eaſter,
in the meane ſeaſon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer orders, lawes, and vowes, yea euen of the
Pope being negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For it is not lawfull for any man, no not for the
Angells to forbid any thing againſt the commaundement of God. Howbeit this
madnes proceedeth from that darkenes and blindnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by miſerable men doe
regarde the worke onely, and thinke that they ſhall obtaine ſaluation
through the greatnes and multitude of workes.<note place="margin">The true end of

darkenes may be ouercome, and not the body deſtroyed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought
to be no other vſe among Chriſtians of faſtings, watchings and labours.
As it is al one before God, whether thou eate fiſh or fleſh: whether thou
drinke wine or water: whether thou weare redde or greene garments: all theſe
are the good creatures of God, made vnto this ende, that we may vſe them:
haue regard only to this, that thou mayſt vſe them with a meane, and
mayſt abſtaine thy ſelfe ſo much from them, as ſhall ſuffize to
ouercome the workes of darkenes. Wherefore it is vnpoſſible that a common

meaſure to one, which to an other is vnder mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: one hath neede of

of him ſelfe, and gouerne his owne body, according to the preſent doctrine
of Paule, whereas he ſayth: <hi>Take no thought for the flesh, to fulfil the

Paule would not haue concealed it.</p>

meates, are quite contrary to the Goſpell: Which Paule hath plainly foretolde
1. Tim. 4: <hi>The Spirit,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>ſpeaketh euidently, that in
the latter times ſome shall depart from the faith, &amp; shall giue heede
vnto ſpirits of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour &amp; doctrines of deuils, which ſpeake lyes
through hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, forbidding to mary, and commaunding to abſtaine from
meates, which God hath created to be receiued with giuing thankes.</hi> No man
ſurely can deny that theſe wordes doe briefly reproue the orders of Monkes
and ſacrificing Prieſtes, ſo cleare and manifeſt are both theſe
wordes, and alſo their prepoſterous religion. Moreouer thou ſeeſt here
alſo, godly Reader, that Paul doth not teach that dotage &amp; womanly
holines of certaine, which chooſe vnto them ſelues certaine dayes, wherein
to faſt to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Sainctes, one to this, an other to that, all which are
blinde proceedings, and builded vpon their owne workes. True religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is,
without choyce of meates and dayes, all the life long to vſe modeſtie and
ſobrietie. For ſeeing that theſe muſt be the armour of light, and it is
requiſite that all our life be vndefiled and chaſt, it behoueth vs ſurely
neuer to put of this armour, but we muſt be found alwayes ſober, temperate,
watching, labouring and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But thoſe doting holy ones one day taſt
nothing but bread &amp; water, &amp; afterward, three whole moneths they daily
be drunken and eate exceſſiuely, euen vntill they be not well in their

proceede from hence, for that fooliſh men conſider &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the worke,

               <note place="margin">Ioy in the Lord a frute of faith, without which there is no true
ioy but ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; feare.</note> This ioy is a frute of faith, moſt
certainly following it, as Paule witneſſeth Gal. 5 where he ſayth:
<hi>The frute of the Spirit is loue, ioy, peace, longe ſuffering, gentlenes,
goodnes, faith, meekenes, temperancie, &amp;c.</hi> Neither can it be that that
hart ſhould reioyce in the Lorde, which hath not yet beleeued in him.
Whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that where no faith is, there can be nothing
but feare, trembling, horrour, and ſadnes, as often as ſuch either remember
God, or heare him named: yea hatred and <pb n="255" facs="tcp:9413:136"/> enmitie of God
remaineth in ſuch harts, the cauſe whereof is, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart voyd of
faith, findeth it ſelfe defiled with ſinnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it douteth not but
that it hath deſerued the vengeance of God, that ſinnes can not but be
hated of God which is iuſt, &amp; ſo, when it doth not beleeue that God
will be mercifull and fauourable vnto it, how can it not but deteſt all
memorie of him? ſo farre is it of that it can reioyce in the Lord, the
reuenger of ſinnes. Theſe two things, the knowledge of ſinne, and of the
vengeance of God prepared for ſinnes are in the hart of the vnbeleeuer, which
hart as it is vnbeleeuing, ſo hath it no hope of pardon, and therefore what
other thing can theſe thinges worke in it, but cauſe it to be troubled,
caſt downe and alwayes fearefull, and greatly terrified, and to thinke that
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vengeance of God doth euery moment hang ouer it, that ſo that may be
verified which Salomon ſayth:<note place="margin">

               <hi>The vngodly fleeth when no man purſueth him.</hi> And that which is
ſayd Deut. 28: <hi>The Lord shall giue thee a fearefull hart, and thy life

water that it ſhould burne like vnto the fire, for it can caſt none of this
ioy, it alwayes feeleth in conſcience, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging hande of God is
heauie vpon it. Whereupon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth Pſal. 32. <hi>Be glad O ye
righteous, and reioyce in the Lorde: and be ioyfull all ye that are true of

Sinners muſt firſt be ſhewed, how they may be deliuered from ſinnes,
and may obtaine God to be fauorable vnto them, which when they haue learned and
ſo obtained, it followeth that they do of their owne accord reioyce in the
Lorde, being deliuered from remorſe of conſcience.</p>
            <p>But if any demaund, how one may be deliuered from remorſe of
conſcience, and haue God mercifull vnto him, that is declared before at

a man may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from remorſe of conſcience, and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of

But the Goſpell promiſeth that Chriſt is giuen to vs, that he may take
away our ſinnes, and be our high Prieſt, Mediatour and Aduocate before God,
that ſo we may nothing dout, but that our ſinnes through Chriſt onely and
his workes are forgiuen vs, and that we are reconciled to God, and that by this
meanes our conſcience is deliuered and comforted.</p>

               <note place="margin">The belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth in the

it ſtandeth with a ſtronge and bold confidence, it feareth not leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
euill come vnto it, it being quiet from all feare of vengeance and
diſpleaſure, is merie, and glad of ſo incomparable grace and goodnes of
God giuen vnto it freely and moſt aboundantly in Chriſt. Wherefore there
muſt needes forthwith proceede from ſuch a faith, loue, ioy, peace,
gladnes, giuing of thankes, prayſe, &amp; a certaine meruelous delight in
God, as in a moſt deare and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable father, which dealeth ſo fatherly
with vs, and poureth forth his giftes ſo plentifully and in ſo great a
meaſure, vpon them that doe not deſerue them. Behold of ſuch ioy Paule
ſpeaketh here, which truely where it is, there can be no place for ſinne,
or feare of death or hell, yea nothing is there but a ioyfull, quiet and
om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent truſt in God and in his fauour. Wherefore it is called ioy in the
Lord, not in gold or ſiluer, gluttonie or drunkennes, in delicates or
ſinging, health, knowledge, wiſedom, power, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, friendſhip, fauour,
no nor in good workes, holines, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is without God. Of theſe
thou ſhalt take but a deceitfull and vaine ioy,<note place="margin">Vaine
ioy.</note> which can not pearſe the hart, or enter vnto the bottom thereof,
whereof thou mayſt rightly ſay that which is wont to be ſpoken as a
prouerbe amonge the Germanes: This man reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, but he feeleth not any ioy
in his hart. There is one ful &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy, which the beleeuers take of
and in the Lord, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, then to commit them ſelues vnto him,
and of him alone to reioyce, truſt and preſume, as of a moſt fauourable
and louing father. Whatſoeuer ioy is not after this ſort, the Lord doth
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and reiect it, whereof Ieremie ſpeaketh chap. 9: <hi>Let not the
wiſe man reioyce in his wiſedom, nor the ſtronge man in his ſtrength,
neither the rich man in his riches: but whoſo will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, let him reioyce

wherfore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth in an other place: <hi>Yea though I walke through
the valley of the shadow of death, I will feare no euill.</hi> Pſal. 23. And
Paule ſayth Rom. 8: <hi>VVho shall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt?
shal tribulation or anguish, or perſecution, or famine, or nakednes, or
peril, or ſword? I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor Angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor thinges preſent, nor things to come, nor
heigth nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to ſeparate vs from

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe I ſay reioyce.</hi> This repetition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle

liue in the middes of ſinnes, and therefore in the middes of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
both which do moue vs vnto ſadnes &amp; heauines. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle
purpoſing to comfort vs againſt theſe, exhorteth vs that we ſhould

God with his goodnes exceedeth the euill of ſinne: ſo much more alwayes to
reioyce in him, when we are ſorowfull becauſe of our ſinnes, which albeit
by nature they bring ſadnes and ſorow with them, yet foraſmuch as they
can not bringe ſo much hurt, as Chriſt, if we beleeue in him, bringeth
profit and ſafetie, ioy in the Lord ought alwayes to haue the firſt place
with vs, and farre to ouercome the ſorow and ſadnes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commeth by reaſon
of our ſinnes. For we muſt alwayes thinke on that which Iohn writeth:

               <hi>Let your patient minde be knowne vnto all men.</hi> He hath 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:9413:138"/> already taught, howe men ought to behaue them ſelues
toward God, namely that they muſt ſerue him with a cheerfull hart and
continuall ioy: now he declareth in few wordes, how the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ought to
behaue them ſelues toward men, ſaying: <hi>Let your patient mind be knowne
vnto all men.</hi> Which wordes are thus much in effect: Be ioyful toward God,
alwaies reioycing in &amp; of him,<note place="margin">What it is to let our

mind, &amp; pliant, applying your ſelues to all, &amp; ſo behauing your
ſelues, that ye be ready to do and ſuffer all things, &amp; to yeeld in
euery thing, as much as may be by any meanes without tranſgreſſing the
commaundement of God, whereby ye may approue your ſelues to all men, and
pleaſe all in that which is good: not onely hurting none, but alſo taking
in good worth all things of al men, interpreting aright the ſayings of al
men, &amp; accepting them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better part, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may plainly ſee you to
be them, vnto whom all things are alike, which take in good part whatſoeuer
betideth you, which ſtick in nothing, which would not diſagree with any man
for any cauſe, which be rich w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the rich, poore with the poore, reioycing
with them that reioyce, weeping with them that weepe, &amp; to be briefe, which
be made all things to all men, that all men muſt needes acknowledge that ye
are grieuous to none, but agreeable, of a patient mind, pliant, and obedient
toward all in all thinges. The Greeke worde <hi>epieices</hi> which the
Apoſtle here vſeth, meaneth the ſame, which ſignifieth in our tongue a
patient and pliant mind, whereby one doth ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſhew him ſelfe
indifferent to others, that he is the ſame to one that he is to an other,
applying him ſelfe indifferently to the will of all, not requiring him
ſelfe to be counted for a rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the reſt ought to apply and
order them ſelues.</p>
            <p>An old Interpreter tranſlateth it modeſtie, which, if thou
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it aright, and not for the onely moderation &amp; temperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of
meate and apparell, as it is wont commonly to be taken, is not altogither
vnfitly tranſlated, namely, if thou vnderſtand it to be a vertue, whereby
one thinking modeſtly of him ſelf, endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to order and apply him
ſelfe vnto all, according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and abilitie of euery one, ready
to permit, to take in good part, to obey, to giue place, to doe, to omit, to
ſuffer all thinges, as he ſhall ſee it will profit his neighbour, albeit
he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hinderance and loſſe of his ſubſtance, name, and
body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. That theſe thinges may be made more playne, it ſhall be 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:9413:138"/> good to declare them by examples.<note place="margin">An
example of a patient minde in Paule.</note> Paule 1. Cor. 9 writeth thus of him
ſelf: <hi>Vnto the Iewes I become as a Iew, that I may winne the Iewes: to
them that are vnder the lawe, as though I were vnder the lawe: to them that are
without lawe, as though I were without lawe (when I am not without lawe as
pertaining to God, but am in the lavve through Chriſt) I am made all thinges
to all men, that I might by all meanes ſaue ſome.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou
ſeeſt here the patient &amp; pliant minde rightly obſeruing thoſe
things which are here commaunded. For thoſe things that he writeth of him
ſelfe haue this meaning: Sometimes he did eate, drinke, and doe all thinges
as a Iewe, albeit it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhould ſo doe:
ſometimes he did eate and drinke with the Gentiles, and did all thinges as
free from the lawe. For onely faith in God, and loue toward our neighbour, are
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required, all other thinges are free, ſo that we may freely
obſerue them for one mans ſake, &amp; omit them for an other mans ſake,
as we ſhall perceiue it to be profitable to euery one.</p>
            <p>Now it is contrary to this modeſtie or meekenes, if one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
an impatient mind, truſteth to his owne wit,<note place="margin">An impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
minde what it doth.</note> and contendeth that one thing among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt is
neceſſary, which thou muſt either omit or obſerue, and ſo applying
him ſelfe vnto none, but conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to haue all other to apply them ſelues
vnto him, he neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth &amp; peruerteth the ſoftnes &amp; meekenes which is
here taught, yea &amp; the libertie of faith alſo: ſuch ſome of the Iewes
were, vnto whom we muſt giue no place, euen as Paule yeelded not vnto them.
We ſee the ſame example commonly in Chriſt, but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matth. 12,
&amp; Mar. 2. where we reade that he ſuffered his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to breake the
Sabbath, &amp; he him ſelfe alſo, when the caſe ſo required, did breake
it, when it was otherwiſe, he did keepe it, whereof he gaue this reaſon:
<hi>The Sonne of man is Lord, euen of the Sabbath.</hi> Which is as much to
ſay as: the Sabbath is free, that thou mayſt breake it for one mans ſake
and commoditie, and for the ſake and commoditie of an other thou mayſt
keepe it. So Paule cauſed Timothe to be circumciſed becauſe of the Iewes,
for that they thought that it was of importance to their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: againe
he would not haue Titus circumciſed, becauſe certain Iewes did vniuſtly
vrge it, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumciſion of Titus would haue bene rather a
confirmation of errour vnto them, then haue profited them any thing. Paule
therefore would keepe circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <pb n="260" facs="tcp:9413:139"/> free, that he
might ſometime vſe it, and ſometime not vſe it, as he ſhould perceiue
it to be commodious and profitable to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces &amp; decrees of men

neceſſary to ſaluation, they are to be vtterly contemned, and thoſe
thinges that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe, are moſt freely to be done: but if he
ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them as neceſſary, if any man might be holpen or
edified in any thinge by the obſeruation of them, ſurely they were to be
obſerued, but freely, and of loue onely, as alſo they are to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if the omitting of them may be profitable to any. The reaſon of this libertie
is this: The Sonne of man is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: if of the Sabbath, howe much
more of the traditions of men? Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt obſerue vpon this
libertie, it can not hurt any, but to obſerue them of neceſſitie, it
extinguiſheth faith and the Goſpell. Likewiſe, if one liue as yet in a
Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if he obſerue the vowes and ordinaunces of that life vpon
Chriſtian libertie, and of loue to his brethren that he may edifie them, and
of no neceſſitie, neither with the hinderance of his owne or other mens
ſaluation, he ſhall doe godly, for he is free: but if thoſe thinges be
ſtraitly required as neceſſary to ſaluation, then before thou ſuffer
thy ſelfe to be brought into this errour, Monaſteries, ſhauings, hoods,
vowes, rules, ordinaunces, and all ſuch like muſt be left, and the contrary
muſt be done, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that onely faith and loue are neceſſary for a
Chriſtian, and that all other thinges are free, ſo that he may eyther omit
or doe them for the edifying and cauſe of them with whom he liueth.
Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt obſerue vpon libertie and of loue, is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but
if thou obſerue any thing of neceſſitie it is vngodly. The ſame is to
be ſayd of all other ordinaunces and decrees of men, which are wont to be
obſerued in Monaſteries, that whatſoeuer doth not diſagree with the
worde of God, thou mayſt being free eyther obſerue or omit it, according as
thou ſhalt knowe it to be profitable and acceptable to them, with whom thou
art conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: but if they be required as neceſſary, reiect them all
vtterly, and tread them vnder thy feete.</p>
            <p>Hereupon thou now ſeeſt, what a deuiliſh thing the Papacie
&amp; Monaſteries be. For whatſoeuer things be fre &amp; to be permitted 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9413:139"/> to free loue onely, they make them neceſſary,<note place="margin">Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty turned of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes into meere
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</note> and ſay the keeping of them is of importance to
ſaluation, wherby truely as much as is in them, they togither peruert and
extinguiſh the Goſpell and faith. I paſſe ouer with ſilence, that
they hereupon ſet and ſell the care of the bellie in ſteede of the
ſeruice of God. For how many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them at this day do for Gods cauſe,
&amp; not rather for the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſake, take vpon them to be Monkes or
Clerkes, do frequent the quier, ſing, pray, ſay Maſſe, or doe any
ſuch thinge, wherein they counterfait and corrupt the true worſhip &amp;
ſeruice of God? The common ſubuerſion of all Monaſteries were the
beſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all theſe thinges, from which ſo much
diſcommoditie and no whit of profite may be looked for. Before one
Monaſterie could be perſwaded concerning true Chriſtian libertie,
infinite thouſands of ſoules in others ſhould periſh, wherefore
foraſmuch as they bringe no commoditie at all, neither is there any neede of
them, and they are cauſe of greater hinderance to a Chriſtian common weale,
then can be thought, and can not by any meanes be reformed, what can be more
profitable, then that they be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowne and aboliſhed?</p>
            <p>Moreouer that we may admoniſh here concerning the ciuill
Magiſtrate, when he commaundeth or requireth any thing,<note place="margin">Obedience to the ciuill Magiſtrate doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der Chriſtian
libertie.</note> yea if he compel thereunto, we muſt obey, for there commeth
no loſſe of Chriſtian libertie or of faith hereby, foraſmuch as they
doe not contend that thoſe thinges are neceſſary to ſaluation which
they do ordaine or require, but onely to maintaine outward rule, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
tranquillitie and gouernment, &amp; ſo the conſcience remaineth free.
Wherefore, foraſmuch as it doth nothing hinder faith to do thoſe things
which the ciuill Magiſtrate commaundeth, but doth alſo profit the common
weale, it ſhall be without dout a point of Chriſtian obedience to endeuour
to do them with a willing mind, that we may be ſuch as are pliant &amp;
agreeable to all men, willing to doe all things, ready to deſerue well of
euery one, &amp; to gratifie all. Howbeit if any ſhould contend that thoſe
commaundements of the ciuill Magiſtrate be neceſſary to ſaluation,
then, as it is ſayd of the traditions of the Papiſtes, the contrary rather
were to be done, or at the leſt it were to be witneſſed, that thou
dooſt them onely for the common weales ſake, becauſe ſo it is
profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others, and not, that thou mayſt obtaine ſaluation by them,
which we haue gotten by Chriſt Ieſus alone, as many of vs as 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:9413:140"/> beleeue in him. According to this doctrine &amp; the
examples before mentioned euery one ought to behaue him ſelfe in euery thinge
&amp; toward all men, as Paule here teacheth, that he ſticke not to his owne
iudgement or right, but that he ſhew him ſelfe pliant vnto others, and haue
regard of thoſe thinges, which he ſhall knowe will be acceptable and
profitable to his neighbours.</p>
            <p>When therefore it doth nothing hinder thy faith, and profiteth thy
neighbour to yeeld ſomewhat of thine owne right, if thou doe it not, thou art
without charitie, &amp; neglecteſt that Chriſtian ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; patient
mind that Paule here ſpeaketh of: Yea if thou haſt regard hereof, as he
that truly beleeueth in Chriſt ought to haue, thou muſt take it patiently
euen when any man doth iniurie vnto thee, or endamage thee, and ſo interprete
it in the better part, and alwaies think on that,<note place="margin">A moſt
wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſaying of a right Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Martyr.</note> which that Martyr when
all his ſubſtance was taken from him, ſayd: But they ſhall not take
away Chriſt from me. So whatſoeuer chaunceth vnto thee, ſay thou: I haue
as yet ſuffered no loſſe of my faith, why ſhoulde I not take it in good
parte, which my neighbour hath done? why ſhould I not yeeld vnto him, and
apply my ſelfe to his will? Thou canſt ſcarce find a more manifeſt
example hereof,<note place="margin">An example which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to
follow in behauing them ſelues toward their neighbours.</note> then betwene
two vnfeyned friendes: for as they behaue them ſelues one toward an other,
ſo ought a Chriſtian to behaue him ſelfe toward euery one. Either of them
endeuoreth to gratifie other, either of them giueth place to other,
ſuffereth, doth, and omitteth whatſoeuer he ſeeth to be for the profite
and commoditie of the other, &amp; that freely without all conſtraint. Either
of them doth diligently apply him ſelfe to the will of the other, neither of
them compelleth other to follow his mind, &amp; if one ſhould vſe the goods
of an other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other would not be offended, but would take it in good part,
and would not grudge rather to giue more, and that I may ſpeake briefly,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſuch there is no exaction of lawe, no grudging, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
no neceſſitie, but libertie, fauour and good will.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe, ſuch as be impatient and obſtinate, which take
nothing in good part of any man, but go about to make all things ſubiect to
their owne will, and to order all thinges according to their owne
iudgement,<note place="margin">The impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate are cauſe of
much euill.</note> ſuch I ſay trouble the world, and are the cauſe of all
diſcordes, contentions, warres, &amp; whatſoeuer diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie there is,
they ſay afterward, that they did thoſe thinges for the loue of iuſtice,
and for that they endeuoured to defend that <pb n="263" facs="tcp:9413:140"/> which is
right. So that that heathen man ſayd not amiſſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme rigour is
extreme iniurie. And Salomon alſo ſayth Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 7. <hi>Be thou neither
too righteous nor ouer wiſe.</hi> For as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme rigour is extreme iniurie,
ſo too great wiſedom is extreme folly. Which alſo is meant by this common
ſaying: when wiſe men dote they dote beyond meaſure. Surely if God
ſhould deale with vs according to right, we ſhould periſh in a moment,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Paule prayſeth in him this moderation of right, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable patience and gentlenes ſaying 2. Cor. 10: <hi>I beſeech you
by the meekenes and gentlenes of Chriſt,</hi> ſo is it alſo meete that we
doe obſerue a meaſure of our iudgement, right, wiſedom, prudence, and in
all thinges apply our ſelues to the profit &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of others.</p>
            <p>But let vs weie the wordes of the Apoſtle, for they are placed
not without a ſpirituall ſkilfulnes, he ſayth: <hi>Let your patient minde
or ſoftnes be knowne vnto all men.</hi> Where thou muſt not thinke that he
commaundeth thee to be made knowne vnto all men,<note place="margin">How our
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient minde muſt be made knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto all men</note> or that thou
oughteſt to tell thy patient mind or ſoftnes before all men. For he ſayth
not, tell it forth, but let it be knowne, that is, endeuour to practize it
toward men, I doe not commaund that ye ſhoulde thinke or ſpeake of it, but
that ye labour that it may be knowne in deede, while all men doe trie and feele
it, that no man may ſay any other thing of you, then that ye be of a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
minde, and pliant, applying your ſelues to all men, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced ſo to
ſay euen by manifeſt experience. So that if any man were neuer ſo much
bent to ſpeake otherwiſe of you, his mouth might be ſtopped by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
teſtimonie of all other, witneſſing of your patient mind and meekenes. So
ſayth Chriſt Matth. 5. <hi>Let your light ſo shine before men, that they
may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</hi>
And Peter ſayth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Haue your
conuerſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that they which ſpeake euill of
you as of euill doers, may by your good workes, which they shall ſee,
glorifie God in the day of viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> It is not ſurely in our power,
that our patient mind ſhould be knowne and acknowledged of all men, but it
ſhal be ſufficient for vs, if we endeuour that all men may haue triall
thereof in vs, and that no man may finde it wanting in our life.</p>
            <p>Moreouer <hi>[all men]</hi> is not ſo to be taken, that thou
ſhouldeſt vnderſtand thereby all men which are in the world, but rather
all <pb n="264" facs="tcp:9413:141"/> ſortes of men, that we haue regard to be of a
patient mind as wel toward enemies as friendes, as well toward ſeruaunts as
Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſmall as great, poore as rich, ſtraungers as them at home,
toward them that we know not, as toward them with whom we are familiar. For
there are ſome, which behaue them ſelues very gentlely and patiently toward
ſtraungers, but toward them that are in the houſe with them, or with whome
they alwayes keepe company, there are none more obſtinate or froward then
they. And how many are there,<note place="margin">The moſt part are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to
make their patient mind known to the rich and their friendes, but not to the
poore and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> which at great and rich mens handes take all
thinges in good part, interpret euery thinge at the beſt, and moſt gently
beare, whatſoeuer they ſay or doe, but toward the poore and abiects they
ſhewe no gentlenes or meekenes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take any thinge of them in good
part. So we are all ready to doe for our children, parents, friends, &amp;
kinſmen, and moſt fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably interprete and willingly beare whatſoeuer
they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Howe often doe we euen prayſe the manifeſt vices of
our friend, or at the leaſt winke at them, and apply our ſelues moſt
fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto them? but to our enemies &amp; aduerſaries we impart none of this
fauour, in them we can find nothing that is good, nothing that is to be borne,
nothing that can be interpreted in the better part, but we diſprayſe euery
thing, &amp; take it at the worſt. Againſt ſuch parted and vnperfect
patient mindes Paule here ſpeaketh ſaying: <hi>Let your patient mind be
knowne vnto all men:</hi> he wil haue our patient mind and right Chriſtian
meekenes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire toward all, whether they be enemies or
friendes, he will haue vs ſuffer and take in good part all things of all men,
without all reſpect either of perſons or deſerts. And ſuch without dout
will our patient mind be, if it be true and not counterfet: no otherwiſe then
gold remaineth gold, whether a godly or vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man poſſeſſe it, and
the ſiluer, which Iudas, who betrayed the Lorde, had, was not turned into
aſhes, but remayned that which it was, as truely all the good creatures of
God, whoſoeuer haue them, doe continue toward all thinges, that which they
are: So a patient mind which is ſyncere comming of the ſpirit, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
like it ſelfe, whether it light vpon enemies or friends, poore men or rich.
But our nature which is full of deceit &amp; plainly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, doth ſo behaue
it ſelfe, as if that which is gold in the hande of Peter, were turned into a
cole in the hande of Iudas, and it is wont to be patient and plyant toward
riche men, great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, <pb n="265" facs="tcp:9413:141"/> ſtraungers, freinds,
and not toward euerie one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is falſe, vaine, lying,
hypocriticall, and nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and mockerie before God. Hereof now
learne how vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſound and entire, that is, ſpirituall meeknes
and a patient minde is vnto nature, and how few there be which marke this
euell, by reaſon of that deceitfull meekenes and patient minde, though in
outward ſhew verie goodly, which they ſhew vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, thinking that
they do well and iuſtly, in that they are more hard and impatient toward
ſome. For ſo their defiled and filthie nature teacheth them, by her goodly
reaſon, which alwayes iudgeth and doeth againſt the ſpirit and thoſe
thinges that are of the ſpirit, becauſe as Paul ſayth: Rom. 8: <hi>They
that are after the flesh, ſauour the thinges of the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude, it is manifeſt that the Apoſtle hath
compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in theſe few wordes the whole life worthy of a Chriſtian,
which he ought to leade toward his neighbour. For he that is of a patient
minde, pliant and meeke in deede, ſtudieth to deſerue well of all men, as
well concerning the body as concerning the ſoule, as well in deede as in
wordes, and doth alſo beare with a moſt patient minde, the offences and
malice of others. Where ſuch a minde is, there is alſo loue, ioye, peace,
long ſuffering, gentlenes, goodnes, &amp; what ſoeuer is the frute of the
ſpirit Gal. 5. But here fleſh murmureth: If we ſhould endeuour to be ſo
meeke and patient, ſaith the fleſh, that we ſhould take all things in
good part of all men, it would come to paſſe, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be able
to keepe a peece of breade ſafely &amp; in peace for the vniuſt which would
abuſe our meekenes &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mind, they would take away all things, yea
they would not ſuffer vs to liue. Marke how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably &amp; abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
the Apoſtle doth ſatiſfie this diſtruſting &amp; fooliſh
cogitation, euen from this place vnto the ende of this text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi> As though he ſaid:<note place="margin">We muſt make our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient mynde knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare
leaſt any abuſe it to our hurt &amp; hinderance.</note> if there were no
Lord or no God, one might feare, when by his meekenes and patient minde he
compteth all thinges alike, and taketh all thinges in good part, that that
would be damage and hurt vnto him, but now there not onely is a Lord, which
gouerneth all things moſt iuſtly, but he is alſo at hand, he can not
forget or forſake thee, be thou onely of a patient minde and gentle toward
all, let him haue the care of thee, nouriſh, and preſerue thee. He hath
giuen Chriſt the eternall good, how ſhould not he alſo giue thinges
neceſſarie <pb n="266" facs="tcp:9413:142"/> for the belly? He hath farre more, then
can be taken away from thee, and thou foraſmuch as thou haſt Chriſt,
haſt much more then the whole world. Hereunto pertaineth that which is
ſaide Pſal. 55: <hi>Caſt thy burden vpon the Lord, and he shall nourish
thee.</hi> And 1. Pet. 5: <hi>Caſt all your care on him: for he careth for
you.</hi> And Chriſt ſayth Matth. 6: <hi>Behold the foules of the aier and
lilies of the field, &amp;c.</hi> all which agree with the preſent
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the Apoſtle, and haue the ſame meaning which theſe
wordes here haue: <hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtians muſt not be carefull, but muſt
caſt their care on God who careth for them.</note>
               <hi>Be nothing
carefull.</hi> That is, take no care at all for your ſelues, let God care for
you, whoe knoweth and is able to do it, whom ye haue now knowne that he is good
and gracious. The heathen haue not without a cauſe care of this preſent
life, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are ignorant and do not beleeue that they haue a God
who hath care of all, as Chriſt Matth. 6. ſaid: <hi>Be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for
your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drinke: nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on: for after all theſe thinges ſeeke the Gentiles, but
your heauenly Father knoweth, that ye haue neede of all theſe thinges.</hi>
Wherefore let the whole world take from thee, and do thee iniurie, thou ſhalt
alwayes haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and it can not be that thou ſhouldeſt periſh
with any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, vnles they haue firſt taken from thee thy God, but
who can take him from thee, if thou thy ſelfe dooſt not caſt him of?
There is no cauſe therefore that we ſhould be carefull, ſeing that he is
our father and prouideth for vs, which hath all thinges in his own hand, euen
thoſe, which ſeeme to take away thoſe things that be ours from vs, and to
endamage and hurt vs wherein ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they are able. But we haue exceeding
great cauſe alwayes to reioyce in the Lord, when we are of a patient mynde
toward all men, foraſmuch as we are certaine, if ſo be that we beleeue,
that it can by no meanes come to paſſe, that good thinges ſhould be
wanting vnto vs, hauing Almightie God our fauourable and carefull father: whom
they that haue not, let vs ſuffer them to be troubled with carke and care. It
ought to be our onely care, how we may be voyde of care, and be found alwayes
ioyfull in God, and meeke and of a patient mynde toward men. So with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dout
we ſhall trie that which Dauid tried ſaying: <hi>I haue been young &amp;
now am olde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.25.</note> 
               <hi>and yet ſaw I
neuer the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeede begging their bread.</hi> And
that which <pb n="267" facs="tcp:9413:142"/> he ſayth Pſal. 40: <hi>The Lord careth
for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in all thinges let your requeſtes be shewed vnto God in
prayer &amp; ſupplication with giuing of thankes.</hi> In theſe wordes the
Apoſtle teacheth, how our care is to be caſt vpon God, and the meaning of
that which he ſayth is this:<note place="margin">How y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt caſt
their care v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God.</note> Onely be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but if any thing chaunce,
which may make you carefull (as in deede innumerable ſuch are wont to come
vnto thoſe that liue in the world) ſo behaue your ſelues, that ye attempt
nothing at all with your care, what ſoeuer that ſhalbe which chaunceth vnto
you, but caſting of care, turne your ſelues with prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
vnto God, and deſire him that he will bring to paſſe and finiſh that
which your ſelues otherwiſe ſhould in vaine haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with your
care to accompliſh. Howbeit deſire this with giuing of thankes, foraſmuch
as ye haue ſuch a God as hath care of you, and vnto whom ye may ſafely
commit all carke and care for you. But he that will not ſo behaue himſelfe
when any thing happeneth, but will firſt weye all thinges by his owne
reaſon, and order them according to his owne iudgement, and ſo take to
himſelfe the care of his thinges, he ſhall wrap himſelfe in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
diſcommodities, he ſhall loze all ioy and quietnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and yet
ſhall preuaile nothing, but labour in vaine, &amp; plunge himſelfe ſo
much more in troubles and miſeries, that he ſhall not be able to eſcape
out of them againe, which we learne daily both by our owne and by other mens
experience. Now that which Paule here admoniſheth concerning prayer tendeth
vnto this end, leſt that any man ſhould neglect all thinges &amp; commit
them to God, and he himſelfe ſleepe and do nothing at all, no not ſo much
as once pray for them: for he that ſhould vſe this ſlouthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, albeit
he were now quiet, ſhall eaſily be wrapped in cares, whereof he ſhall not
be able to ridde himſelfe: we muſt do our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour and not ſleepe, and
therefore it is that many thinges be incident, which are wont to bring
carefulnes, whereby we might be as it were compelled to pray vnto God.
Wherefore Paule hath not in vaine ioyned togither theſe two: <hi>Be nothing
carefull,</hi> and: <hi>In all thinges let your requeſtes be shewed vnto God
in prayer and ſupplication with giuing of thankes. Nothing</hi> and All do in
deede greatly differ, howbeit the Apoſtle therefore put them togither, that
he might ſignifie that it can not be, but that many and innumerable thinges
be incident, which are wont to <pb n="268" facs="tcp:9413:143"/> bring carke and care, but
that in all them we ought to admit no carefulnes, but alwayes flie vnto prayer,
and commit them all vnto God, &amp; deſire of him thoſe thinges whereof we
haue neede.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt here ſee how our prayer muſt be framed, and what
is the true maner of praying. The Apoſtle ſetteth downe foure thinges,
prayer, ſupplication, giuing of thinkes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts or petitions.<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> Prayer is thoſe wordes or ſpeche, wherein as
ſometimes ſome thing is deſired, ſo alſo other thinges are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
as is the Lords Prayer and the Pſalmes.<note place="margin">Supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Supplication is, when the petition is vrged
or made more earneſt by ſome thing, as when one prayeth for his father, or
for ſome other thinge which is deare and excellent vnto him, as when we praye
vnto God by his mercy, by his ſonne, by his promiſe, by his name, &amp;c.
As Salomon Pſal. 132: <hi>Lord remember Dauid, and all his trouble.</hi> And
Paule Rom. 12: <hi>I beſeech you by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God.</hi> And 2. Cor. 10:
<hi>I beſeech you by the mekenes and gentlenes of Chriſt,<note place="margin">A petition or requeſt.</note> &amp;c.</hi> A petition or
requeſt is, when we name that which is deſired, and for which prayer and
ſupplication is made, as in the Lordes Prayer, all that compoſition of
wordes is called prayer, but thoſe ſeuen thinges for which we pray, as,
halowed be thy name, thy kingdome come, &amp;c. are petitions. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
that ſaying Matth. 7: <hi>Aske, and it shalbe giuen you: ſeeke, and ye
shall fynde: knocke, and it shalbe opened vnto you. For whoſoeuer asketh,
receiueth: and he that ſeeketh fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: and to him that knocketh, it shalbe
opened.</hi> Giuing of thankes is when the benefites of God are
rehearſed,<note place="margin">Giuing of thankes.</note> whereby faith in God
is ſtrengthened, and ſtirred vp ſo much more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to looke for
that which is deſired, &amp; for which we do praie. Wherefore prayer vrgeth
or earneſtly aſketh by ſupplication, but is ſtrengthened and made
ſweete &amp; acceptable by giuing of thankes, and ſo by this ſtrength and
ſweetnes it preuaileth, and obtaineth, what ſoeuer it aſketh. This maner
of prayer we read to haue bin vſed in the Church, and among the holy fathers
of the old Teſtament, which were wont alwayes in their prayers to aſke with
ſupplication and giuing of thankes. The ſame alſo we ſee in the Lordes
Prayer, which beginneth with giuing of thankes and with prayſe, when as euen
in the beginning thereof we confes God a father, vnto whom the godly mynde hath
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe by his fatherly loue and by the loue of his ſonne, vnto which 
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:9413:143"/> ſupplication nothing may be compared, wherefore it is
both the beſt and moſt excellent prayer of all which may be had.</p>
            <p>Moreouer in theſe wordes Paule hath verie well expreſſed the
myſterie of the golden cenſer of the old Teſtament,<note place="margin">The
myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cenſer declared.</note> whereof we read many
thinges in the bookes of Moſes. It was lawfull for the Prieſtes only to
burne incenſe, now all we which beleeue in Chriſt, are Prieſtes,
wherefore it is lawfull for all vs, and for vs onely to burne the incenſe of
prayers. The cenſer that golden veſſel, is the wordes which we vtter in
prayer, ſurely golden and precious, as thoſe are, whereof the Lordes prayer
conſiſteth, the Pſalmes and other prayers of the Scripture. For commonly
in the Scripture veſſels ſignifie wordes, for that our meaninges are
contained in wordes as in a veſſel, and by wordes are vttered and receiued
as out of a veſſell, as wine, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, burning coles, and ſuch like, are
contained in veſſels, and taken out of veſſels. So by the cuppe of
Babylon Apoc. 17. the doctrine of men is vnderſtood, and by the cuppe wherein
the blood of Chriſt is dronke the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Furthermore burning coles,<note place="margin">What is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified
by the burning coles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe was layde.</note> whereupon the
frankincenſe was layde, ſignifie giuing of thankes, and rehearſing of
benefites in prayer, which we are wont to do in making ſupplication. For,
that by fierie coles benefites are ſignified it is manifeſt euen out of the
12. to the Rom. where the Apoſtle reciteth the ſaying of Salomon Prouerb.
25: <hi>If thine enemie hunger, feede him: if he thirſt, giue him drinke: for
in ſo doing thou shalt heape coles of fire on his head.</hi> And benefits may
be rightly called coles of fire, foraſmuch as they inflame the heart with
loue, although it be cold. In the Lawe it was prohibited to laye the
frankincenſe vpon any other coles, but them that were of the altar of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Lord, which ſignifieth, that we muſt not rehearſe our own good deedes in
prayer, as that Phariſe did, Luc. 15: but onely the benefits of God
beſtowed vpon vs in Chriſt. He is our altar,<note place="margin">We muſt
giue thankes to God by Chriſt.</note> by him we muſt offer, for the
benefits receiued by him we muſt giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, and make mention of them in
prayer for the increaſing of our faith. This Paule teacheth Coloſſ. 3.
where he ſayth: <hi>Do all thinges in the name of the Lord Ieſus, giuing
thankes to God the Father by him.</hi> For God can not ſuffer, that thou
ſhouldeſt glorie of any thing els in his ſight, which he declared in a
type or figure Leuit. 10, where we read that Nadah and Abihu the 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:9413:144"/> ſonnes of Aaron were taken and conſumed of the flame
from the altar of God, becauſe they burned incenſe taking other fire then
of the altar of the Lord. The workes of Chriſt only are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God,
wherefore for theſe onely we muſt both giue thankes and reioyce in
prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made in pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er ſignified by
the ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe layd on the burning coles.</note>The incenſe ſignifieth the
petitions made in prayer. For pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are, whereof prayer conſiſteth,
and which aſcend vnto God, according as Paul ſayth: <hi>Let your petitions
be shewed vnto God,</hi> wherein he ſeemeth to haue conſidered and
interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as a ſauour aſcending from the cenſer. As though he had
ſaid: when ye will burne incenſe ſweete and acceptable vnto the Lord,
make, that your petitions be ſhewed vnto God with ſupplication and giuing
of thankes, this incenſe and this ſauour as it is moſt ſweete vnto God,
ſo doth it aſcend ſtraight vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, like vapoures of ſmoke, and
entreth euen vnto the throne of God. And as burning coles do giue a ſtrong
ſauour and make it aſcend vpward: ſo the memorie of the benefites of God,
which we rehearſe by giuing of thankes, and whereof we do as it were
aduertize God and our ſelues, doth make prayer ſtedfaſt and bold, which
cheerefully and gladly aſcendeth into heauen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which truly prayer
fainteth, is cold and of no force. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoeuer thou art, before thou
pray with faith and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, they heart muſt be inflamed with the
memorie of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which God hath beſtowed vpon vs in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome man will demaund, how our petitions be ſhewed
or become manifeſt vnto God, ſeeing that they be not onely knowne vnto him
before we praye, but he alſo doth ſend vs that, which we aſke? Whereunto
I aunſwere: the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned this, that he might teach, of what ſort
true prayer ought to be,<note place="margin">We muſt not praye at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
but be certainly perſwaded that we ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be heard of God.</note> to wit,
aſſured and hauing confidence and truſt in God, which paſſeth not
away into the winde, neither is made at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, as their prayer is, which
pray, and haue no regard, whether God heareth or not, yea rather beleeue that
he doth not heare, which vndoutedly is not to praye or to aſke of God, but to
tempt and mocke God. For if any man did deſire money of me, whom I certainly
knew, not to perſwade himſelfe that he ſhould receiue it, I could not
ſuffer ſuch an aſker, of whom I might aſſure my ſelfe to be mocked:
how much more is God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at our much crying out and babbling, when we do
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually <pb n="271" facs="tcp:9413:144"/> babble much &amp; crie out, &amp; do not
thinke at all whether he heareth vs. Learne therefore here,<note place="margin">How our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are ſhewed vnto God.</note> that they
petitions muſt be ſhewed vnto God, that is, that thou muſt ſo aſke,
that thou dout not, that they petitions be knowne and accepted of God, and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue certainly, that thou ſhalt obtaine what ſoeuer thou doeſt
aſke, with which faith if thou be endued, it ſhall ſo come vnto thee in
deede. For as we belteue, ſo it commeth vnto vs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the ſmoke
carieth the ſauour vpward from the cenſer: ſo faith carieth the petitions
of the beleeuers into the ſight of God, whereby we aſſuredly beleeue,
that our petitions ſhall come vnto God, and that we ſhall vndoutedly
obteine thoſe thinges that we aſke. Paul by theſe wordes <hi>[be
shewed]</hi> did vndoutedly meane that, which is eftſoones in the Pſalmes:
<hi>God hath heard my petition, Giue eare Lord vnto my prayer,</hi> and ſuch
like. Hereof Chriſt ſpeaketh Matth, 21, and Mar. 11. <hi>Whatſoeuer ye
shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye shall receiue it.</hi> And Iames
ſaith chap. 1: <hi>Aske in faith and wauer not, for he that wauereth shall
receiue nothing of the Lord.</hi> Who may not now hereof perceiue, that that
much babbling and crying out, which is made common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the world in
monaſteries, is a mocking and deluding of God? The prayers of theſe, if
they may be called prayers, are aboundantly ſhewed before men, for they crie
out and babble too much, but there is no regard of them with God, they are not
knowne of him, neither come they vnto his eares, that is, he doth by no meanes
heare them, for that they do not beleeue, or are aſſured, that their crying
out or much babbling is heard of God, wherefore as they beleeue, ſo do they
receiue. It was time therefore long ſince, that thoſe mockinges and
blaſphemies of God ſhould be aboliſhed. But if we praye as we are here
taught, there ſhalbe nothing ſurely which we may not obtaine.<note place="margin">Why we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times praie and receiue not.</note> Now we praye for
many things continually, and receiue nothing, neither is it any meruell,
ſeeing we praye ſo, that our petitions be not ſhewed vnto God, for that
we do not beleeue that they be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto him. Wo to our diffidence and
incredulitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the peace of God which paſſeth all vnderſtanding,
shall preſerue your hearts and myndes in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> In how goodly
an order doth Paul here inſtruct a Chriſtian man? Firſt he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him
to be glad and ioyfull in the Lord by faith: ſecondly to ſhew himſelfe
meeke and gentle to all his neighbours. And if <pb n="272" facs="tcp:9413:145"/> thou
ſay, how can I do that without loſſe or hinderance? he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth: The
Lord is at hand. If thou againe obiect: But what if men perſecute me, and
euen bereue me of that I haue? He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: be nothing carefull, but let thy
petitions be ſhewed vnto God. Where if the fleſh againe murmur, what if in
the meane ſeaſon I be oppreſſed and ſpoiled? he concludeth that there
ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be nothing leſſe, the peace of God ſhall preſerue and keepe
thee, whereof I muſt now entreat ſomewhat.<note place="margin">The peace of
God.</note> By the peace of God is not meant here that peace, whereby God is
peaceable and quiet in himſelfe, but that which he giueth vnto vs, and
poureth into our heartes, euen as alſo it is called the word of God which he
giueth vs, that we may preache it and beleeue it. So when he giueth this peace
vnto vs, it is called the peace of God, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue the ſame with
him, when in the world notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we ſuffer affliction.</p>
            <p>Now this peace paſſeth all vnderſtanding, reaſon, and
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man: which is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as though man can not
at all perceiue or know it, for if we haue peace with God, truly it muſt be
felt in our heart and conſcience, otherwiſe our heartes and myndes could
not be preſerued by it, but it is thus to be vnderſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When
tribulation commeth vpon them, which know not to flie vnto God with prayer and
ſupplication, but truſt to their owne wiſedome and care, whereby they
ſeeke peace, but that which reaſon is able to know, which is that, whereby
tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation taketh an end, and is chaunged with outward tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: this
peace doth not paſſe reaſon, but is agreable vnto it, inaſmuch as it is
ſought and found out of it. Wherefore they that are voyd of fayth are
exceedingly diſquieted, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vntill according to the reaſon of the
fleſh they obtaine this peace by heardly deliuering or ridding themſelues
of aduerſitie, not regarding whether they bring that to paſſe by force or
by crafte, as he that hath receiued a wound ſeeketh to haue it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">The peace which the faithfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.</note> &amp;c. But they that
reioyce ſyncerely in the Lord, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for them, that they know
that they haue God fauourable vnto them, and haue aſſured peace with him,
they abyde willingly in tribulation, being nothing carefull for that peace of
reaſon by the remouing of outward troubles, but they endure them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
looking to be ſtrengthned inwardly by faith, taking no care whether the
aduerſities which they ſuffer, ſhall remaine a <pb n="273" facs="tcp:9413:145"/>
ſhort or a long time, whether they ſhalbe temporall or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing, neither
are diſquieted with caring what ende they ſhall haue. They co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit all
things to God, ſeeking not to know, when, how, where, or by whom he wil giue
them quietnes. Wherefore God againe ſheweth them this fauour, that he maketh
the end of their triall to be ſuch, and with ſo great commoditie, as no man
could either ſuſpect or wiſh for. Loe, this is that peace of the
croſſe, the peace of God, the peace of conſcience, true Chriſtian
peace, which maketh that a man outwardly alſo, as much as is in him, liueth
quietly and peaceably with all men, &amp; troubleth no man. This peace reaſon
is not able by any meanes to know or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that a man vnder the
croſſe may haue quietnes of minde and ioy of heart, and peace euen in the
very inuaſion of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: this is the gift and worke of God, knowen to
none, but to him that hath it, and hath tried it.</p>
            <p>Whereas Paul ſaid:<note place="margin">Rom. 15.13.</note> 
               <hi>Now
the God of hope fill you with all ioy &amp; peace in beleeuing,</hi> that which
he calleth in theſe wordes, peace in beleeuing, he calleth in our preſent
text y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace of God. Moreouer Paul ſignifieth in theſe wordes, that
whoſoeuer will reioyce in the Lord by faith, and be meeke and of a patient
minde toward all by loue, the Deuell vndoutedly is againſt him,<note place="margin">The Deuell laboureth to hinder and ſtay the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the faithfull.</note> and will raiſe vp ſome croſſe, that he may
driue him from ſo Chriſtian a purpoſe, wherefore the Apoſtle will haue
euerie one to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt this aſſault of Satan, and to place
his peace there where Satan can not trouble it, namely in God, and not thinke
how he may caſt of the croſſe, but ſuffer the aduerſarie to take on,
and rage as he liſt, he in the meane ſeaſon patiently looking for the
Lord, that he comming may make an ende of aduerſitie and trouble: for by this
meanes his mynde, heart and conſcience are preſerued and kept in peace.
Neither can patience endure, where the heart is not confirmed with this peace,
for that he only which hath this peace doth throughly perſwade himſelfe
that God is fauourable vnto him, &amp; carefull for him, and maketh no accompt
what chaunceth vnto him from creatures. Moreouer let no man vnderſtand here
the heartes and mindes to be the will and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature, but as Paule
himſelfe interpreteth, the heartes and mindes in Chriſt Ieſu, that is,
ſuch as we haue in Chriſt, of Chriſt, and vnder Chriſt. Theſe are the
heartes and mindes which faith and loue cauſe, with which they that be
endued, do <pb n="274" facs="tcp:9413:146"/> behaue themſelues moſt godly toward God,
and moſt louingly and gently toward their neighbour. Toward God they ſo
behaue themſelues, that they beleeue in him, and loue him with their whole
heart, and are alſo moſt ready, with their whole heart and with all their
cogitations to do thoſe thinges which ſhalbe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God and their
neighbours, as much as, yea more then they are able. Such heartes and mindes
the Deuell goeth about with the feare of death and other troubles to terrifie
and driue from this godlines, erecting a falſe hope there againſt by the
deuiſes and imaginations of men, wherewith the minde is ſeduced, that it
may ſeeke to be comforted and holpen of it ſelfe or other creatures, which
if it do, ſurely he hath drawne ſuch a man from the care of God, and
wrapped him in his owne vaine care.</p>
            <p>Thus haſt thou godly reader, out of this ſhort text a moſt
plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull inſtruction of Chriſtian life, how thou muſt liue toward God
and thy neighbour, namely that thou muſt beleeue that God is all thinges vnto
thee, and thou againe muſt be all thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy neighbours, that thou
muſt ſhewe thy ſelfe ſuch a one to thy neighbour, as God hath ſhewed
himſelfe to thee, that thou muſt receiue of God and giue to thy neighbour:

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His text toucheth the very pith of Paules chiefe doctrine, the
cauſe why it is well vnderſtood of ſo few, is not, for that it is ſo
obſcure and hard, but becauſe there is almoſt no knowledge of faith left
in the world, without which it can not be that one ſhould rightly
vnderſtand Paule, who euerie where intreateth of faith with ſuch force of
the ſpirit as he is able. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeake ſomewhat, that this
text may be made plaine, and that I may more conueniently bring light vnto it
in expounding it, I will ſpeake a few wordes in maner of a preface. Firſt
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that that treatiſe, wherein is intreated of
good workes, doth farre differ from that wherein is intreated of
iuſtification, as there is verie great difference betweene the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and the working, betweene a man &amp; his worke. Now iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is of
man, and not of workes: for man is either iuſtified and ſaued, or iudged
and condemned, and not workes. Neither is it in controuerſie among the godly,
that man is iuſtified by no worke, but righteouſnes muſt come vnto him
from ſome other where, then from his owne workes. For Moſes writeth of Abel
after this ſort: <hi>The Lord had reſpect vnto Abel, and to 
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:9413:147"/> his oblation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">God firſt
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the man, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worke.</note> Firſt he had reſpect to Abel
himſelfe, then to his oblation, becauſe that Abel was firſt counted
righteous, entire, and acceptable vnto God, and then for his ſake his
oblation alſo was alowed, and not he becauſe of his oblation. Againe, God
had no reſpect to Cain, and therefore neither to his oblation: where againe
thou ſeeſt, that regard is had firſt of the worker the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worke. Of
this place it is verie plainly gathered, that no worke can be allowed of God,
whereas he which worketh that worke, was not firſt acceptable to him: and
againe, that no worke is diſalowed of him, vnles the authour thereof be
diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed before. I thinke that theſe thinges wilbe ſufficient
concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter in this place, of which it is eaſie to vnderſtand,
that there are two ſortes of workes: ſome going before iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſome following it, and that theſe laſt are good workes in deede, but
that thoſe other do onely appeare to be good. Hereof commeth ſuch
diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betweene God, and thoſe counterfect holy ones, for this
cauſe nature and reaſon riſe and rage againſt the holy Ghoſt, this is
that whereof almoſt all the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intreateth. The Lord in his word
defineth, that all workes that goe before iuſtification, are euell, and of no
importaunce, and requireth that man himſelfe before all thinges be
iuſtified. Againe,<note place="margin">Man before he is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate can doe
nothing that is good.</note> he pronounceth all men, which are not yet
regenerate, and haue not chaunged that nature, which they receiued of their
parentes, with the newe creature of Chriſt, to be vnrighteous and wicked,
according to that ſaying Pſal. 116: <hi>All men are lyars,</hi> that is,
vnable to performe their dutie, and to doe thoſe thinges, which by right they
ought. And Gen. 6: <hi>The heart of man is alwayes ready vnto euell,</hi>
whereby vndoutedly it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that he is able to do nothing that
is good, which hath the fountaine of actions, that is his heart, corrupted. And
if he do many workes which in outward ſhew ſeeme good,<note place="margin">God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard firſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worker then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke, reaſon
doth quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, affirming that by his workes the worker is
iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</note> they are no better then the oblation of Cain.</p>
            <p>Here againſt commeth forth reaſon our reuerend maiſtres
ſeeming to her ſelfe meruelous wiſe, yet in deede is vnwiſe and blynde,
and is not aſhamed to gainſay her God, &amp; to reproue him of lying, ſhe
being furniſhed with her follies and verie ſtrawie armour, to wit, the
light of nature, free will, the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, alſo with the bookes
of the heathen and with the doctrines of men. She dareth with her euell
ſounding ſtringes make a <pb n="277" facs="tcp:9413:147"/> noyce againſt God, that
the workes of a man euen not yet iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are good workes, and not workes
like vnto Cains, (which God pronounceth) yea and ſo good, that he that
worketh them is iuſtified by them. For ſo Ariſtotle hath taught, that he
that worketh well is made good. Vnto this ſaying ſhe leaueth and ſticketh
vnmoueably, and wreſteth the Scripture cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, contending that God
will haue reſpect firſt to the workes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the worker. Such verie
deueliſh doctrine beareth the ſway now euerie where in ſcholes, colledges
&amp; monaſteries, wherein no other ſaincts, then Cain was, haue rule and
authoritie. Now of this errour an other immediatly ſpringeth. They which
attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſo much to workes, &amp; do not accordingly eſteeme the worker
and ſound iuſtification, go ſo farre, that they aſcribe all merit and
ſoueraigne righteouſnes to workes done before iuſtification, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
almoſt no account of faith, alleaging that which Iames ſaith, that without
workes it is dead. Which ſentence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle when they litle
vnderſtand, they attribute almoſt nothing to faith, they alwayes ſticke
to workes, whereby they thinke they do merit exceedingly of God, and are
perſwaded that for their workes ſake they ſhall obtaine the fauour of
God, and by this meanes do they continually diſagree with God, ſhewing
themſelues to be the right poſteritie of Cain. God hath reſpect vnto man,
theſe to the workes of man: God aloweth the workes for his ſake that
worketh, theſe require that for the workes ſake the worker may be crowned.
Now God goeth not from his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as it is meete and iuſt, and theſe
will ſeeme nothing leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to erre in any reſpect. They will not
haue their good workes contemned, reaſon to be nothing eſteemed, free will
to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vneffectuall, or ſurely, if thou doeſt here ſtriue
againſt them, they beginne to be angrie with God, and count it a ſmall
matter to kill their brother Abel.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps thou wilt ſay: what is needfull to be done? by
what meanes ſhall I firſt of all become righteous, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God?
How ſhall I attaine to this perfect iuſtification? The Goſpell
aunſwereth, preaching that it is neceſſarie that thou heare Chriſt, and
repoſe thy ſelfe wholy in him, denying thy ſelfe, &amp; diſtruſting
all thine owne ſtrength. By this meanes thou ſhalt be chaunged from Cain to
Abel, &amp; being thy ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, ſhalt offer acceptable giftes to
the Lord. This faith, as <pb n="278" facs="tcp:9413:148"/> it is preached vnto thee for no
merit of thine owne, ſo is it giuen vnto thee for no deſeruing of thine,
but of meere grace. And this faith iuſtifieth thee, thou being endued
herewith the Lord remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all thy ſynnes, and that by the contemplation of
Chriſt his ſonne, in whom this faith beleeueth and truſteth. Moreouer he
giueth vnto ſuch a faith his ſpirit, which doth throughly chaunge a man and
make him new, ſo that now he hath other reaſon, and an other will, then
before, namely that which is ready vnto good. Such a one worketh nothing but
good workes, neither can it be but good, which he being good before, ſhall
do, whereof I haue ſpoken ſomewhat before. Wherefore nothing els is
required vnto iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to
iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</note> then to heare Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, and to
beleeue in him, howbeit neither of theſe is the worke of nature, but both of
onely grace. He therefore that goeth about to attaine hereunto by workes,
ſhutteth the way to the Goſpell, to faith, grace, Chriſt, God, and all
thinges that helpe vnto ſaluation. Againe, vnto good workes there is neede
onely of iuſtification, which he that hath attained, doth worke onely good
workes, and beſide ſuch a one none. Hereof it ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeareth,
that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the thinges following, and the order of mans ſaluation
are after this ſort. Firſt of all is required, that thou heare the word of
God, next that thou beleeue, then that thou do worke, &amp; ſo at the laſt
become ſaued and happie. He which chaungeth this order, without doute is not
of God. Paul alſo deſcribeth this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Rom. 10, ſaying:
<hi>VVhoſoeuer shall call vpon the Name of the Lord, shalbe ſaued. But how
shal they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued? and how shall they
beleeue in him, of whom they haue not heard? and how shall they heare without a
preacher? and how shal they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt teacheth vs to pray the Lord of the harueſt, that he would ſend
forth labourers into his harueſt, that is, ſyncere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
heare theſe preach the true word of God, we may beleeue, which faith
iuſtifieth a man, and maketh him godly in deede, that he now calleth vpon God
in the ſpirit of the ſonnes, and worketh nothing but that which is good,
and thus beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a man ſaued. Which is no other thing, then if I ſay: He
that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth ſhalbe ſaued. Againe, he that worketh without faith is
condemned, as Chriſt ſaith: He that doth not beleeue ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
from which no workes ſhall deliuer him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:9413:148"/>Confer now herewith thoſe things which are
wont common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſpoken of honeſtie and righteouſnes. Are they not
wont thus to ſay? I will endeuour, that I may yet become honeſt. It is
meete ſurely that we ſtudy to lead an honeſt life and to do good workes.
Well, admit this to be ſo. But if one the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſke them how we may applie our
ſelues vnto honeſtie, and by what meanes we may attaine vnto it: they
aunſwere, that we muſt faſt, praie, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent temples, auoide ſynnes

Hereupon one becommeth a Charterhouſe Monke, an other choſeth ſome other
order of monkes: an other is conſecrated a Prieſt: ſome torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their
fleſh by wearing heare cloth: other ſcourge their bodies with whipps, other
afflict themſelues after other ſorts. But theſe are euen of Cains broode,
&amp; their workes are no whit better then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of Cain. For the man
himſelfe continueth the ſame that he was before, vngodly, and without all
iuſtification: there is a certaine chaunge made only of outward workes, of
apparell, of places &amp;c. Neither are theſe any other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very apes of
ſaincts, for they do prepoſterouſly imitate the maners &amp; workes of
ſaincts, when as they themſelues are nothing leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaincts. They
ſcarce thinke of faith, they preſume onely of ſuch workes as ſeeme good
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, thinking by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come vnto heauen. Of whom Chriſt
ſaid: Enter in at the ſtraight gate: for I ſay vnto you, many ſeeke to
enter in at it, &amp; can not. Why is this? becauſe they know not what this
narrow gate is. For it is faith, which doth altogither annihilate or make a man
nothing in his owne eyes, &amp; requireth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he put no truſt in any of his
owne works, but that he leane only to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God, &amp; be prepared for
it to leaue &amp; ſuffer all things. But thoſe holy ones of Cains broode
thinke their good workes to be the narrow gate, &amp; are not therefore
extenuated, or made leſſe, whereby they might enter: they do not leaue
confidence in their workes, but gathering them togither in great coules, they
hang them about them, and ſo go about to enter in being burdened, and as it
were ſwollen bigge, which is as poſſible for them, as for a camell with
his bounched backe to go through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye of a needle.</p>
            <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſhalt begin to preach vnto theſe of faith, they
laugh and hiſſe at thee: Doeſt thou count vs, ſay they, for Turkes and
Heathen, whom it behoueth now firſt to learne faith? Is there ſuch a
companie of Prieſts, Monkes and Nunnes, &amp; is not faith knowne? Who
knoweth not what he ought to beleeue? euen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt <pb n="280" facs="tcp:9413:149"/>
ſynners know that. And being after this ſort animated and ſtirred vp,
they thinke that they be abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly endued with faith, and that the reſt is
now to be finiſhed &amp; made perfect by workes. Whereupon they make too
ſmall &amp; ſclender account of faith, as I haue ſaid, becauſe they are
ignorant both what faith is, &amp; that it alone doth iuſtifie. They call it
faith, when they beleeue thoſe things which they haue heard of Chriſt,
which kynde of faith the Deuels alſo haue, &amp; yet are nothing therefore
iuſtified: but this deſerueth to be called rather an opinion of men then
fayth. For as we do oftentimes admoniſh, it is not ſufficient, that thou
maieſt worthely be called a Chriſtian, to beleeue thoſe things to be
true, which are preached of Chriſt, which kinde of faith they of Cains broode
alſo haue:<note place="margin">A true faith.</note> but thou muſt alſo
nothing doute, that thou art of the number of them, vnto whom all thoſe
benefits of Chriſt are giuen &amp; exhibited. Which he that beleeueth, muſt
plainly confes, that he is holy, godly, righteous, the ſonne of God, and
certaine of ſaluation, &amp; that by no merit of his owne, but by the only
mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God poured forth vpon him for Chriſtes ſake. Which he beleeeueth
to be ſo rich and plentifull, as it is in deede, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be as it

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted in thine own ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, for all thy righteouſnes &amp;
ſaluation is of only grace, whereunto only thou muſt truſt: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou

conſtantly to ſtand and perſeuer, as it is the gift of the Lord, and not
in our owne ſtrength, ſo ought we alwayes to haue a care and feare
thereof.</p>
            <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they of Cains broode heare faith to be entreated of after
this ſort, they can not ſufficiently maruell at our madnes, as it ſeemes
vnto them. God turne this away from me, ſay they, that I ſhould affirme my
ſelfe holy and godly, farre be this arrogancie and raſhnes from me. I am
many wayes a miſerable ſinner, I ſhould be mad, if I ſhould arrogate
holines vnto my ſelfe. And thus they mocke at true faith, and count ſuch
doctrine as this for execrable errour, and goe about with might and mayne to
extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Goſpell. Theſe are they that deny the faith of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Denyers of the faith of Chriſt.</note> &amp;
perſecute it in the whole world, of whom Paule ſpeaketh 1. Tim. 4: <hi>In
the latter times many shall depart from the faith, &amp;c.</hi> For we ſee it
brought to paſſe by the meanes of theſe, that true faith lyeth euery
where oppreſſed, is not onely not preached, but alſo commonly
diſallowed and condemned, with all them that either teach or profes it. The
Pope, Biſhops, Colleges, Monaſteries, and Vniuerſities haue now aboue
fiue hundred yeares perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with one mind and conſent, yea and that
maruelous ſtiffely and obſtinately, and haue done no other thing vnto the
world, but euery where as much as they were able driuen many vnto hell. Which
truely both hath bene and is that laſt and moſt hurtfull perſecution of
Antichriſt: The Lord at the laſt bring it to an end.</p>
            <p>If any obiect againſt the admiration or rather mad
ſenſleſnes of theſe men, that we doe nothing but that that is meete, if
we count our ſelues euen holy, truſting to the goodnes of God iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

               <hi>The Spirit of God beareth

that the Prophet and Apoſtle would not teach vs in theſe wordes, or giue vs
an example, which we ſhould follow, but that they being peculiarly and
ſpeciall enlightened, receiued ſuch reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them ſelues that they
were holy. And after this ſort they miſinterpret and wreſt whatſoeuer
place of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affirmeth that we are holy, ſaying that ſuch
doctrines are not written for vs, but that they are rather peculiar miracles
and prerogatiues as they call them, which doe not belonge to all. Which forged
imagination we account of, as hauing come from <pb n="282" facs="tcp:9413:150"/> their
ſick braine, who when as they be them ſelues void of faith, and ſauour
nothing of the ſpirit, thinke and contend, that there be none which haue
ſounde faith and the ſpirit, whereby ſurely they beleeue them ſelues to
be thornes and thiſtles, not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but rather enemies and
deſtroyers of Chriſtians, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>Againe, they are of this beleefe, that they ſhall be righteous
&amp; holy by their owne workes, and that becauſe of them God will giue vnto
them ſaluation and eternal bleſſednes.<note place="margin">The Papiſtes
attribute more to their owne workes then to God his grace.</note> But here
ſee the madnes of men: in their opinion and iudgement it is a Chriſtian
thinge, to thinke that we ſhall be righteous and ſaued becauſe of our
workes, and to beleeue that theſe thinges are giuen by the grace of God, they
condemne as hereticall. They attribute that to their owne workes which they
attribute not to the grace of God: they affirme that they doe ſaue vs, and
not this: they truſt to works, they can not truſt to Gods grace: which
blindnes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely commeth vnto them, inaſmuch as they will not build vpon
the rocke, let them build vpon the ſand, &amp; ſo be drowned by their owne
meanes, that by their owne workes and ſatisfactions they may torment them
ſelues euen vnto death, gratifying Satan herein, for that they will not
reſt vpon the grace of God, &amp; ſerue the Lord with a gentle and ſweete
ſeruice.<note place="margin">They that are endued with a true faith, are both
ioyfull in God, and dutifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their neighbours.</note> For they that are
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with true faith, and doe reſt vpon the grace of the Lord, it is
meruelous, how they are in God, by his goodnes, of moſt quiet mindes, and
greatly reioycing with holy ioy: whereupon they doe alſo with pleaſure
apply them ſelues to good workes, not to ſuch as theſe of Cains broode
doe, as to fayned prayers, faſting, baſe &amp; filthy apparell, &amp;
ſuch like trifles, but to true &amp; right good workes, whereby their
neighbour is profited, and from whence no ſmall commoditie redoundeth vnto
men. Moreouer, they are of moſt ready mindes to ſuffer whatſoeuer
thinges, inaſmuch as they are certaine that God doth fauour them, and hath a
care of them. Theſe are right honeſt and profitable men, of whom both God
is glorified, &amp; men much profited. When as thoſe of Cains broode ſerue
to no vſe, either before God or before men, no, they doe not ſo much as
profit them ſelues, but are onely an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lumpe of earth, yea not
onely vnprofitable, but exceeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and hurtfull alſo both to them
ſelues, and to others. For inaſmuch as they are deſtitute of true faith,
they can not giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <pb n="283" facs="tcp:9413:150"/> God his due glory,<note place="margin">Where true faith is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there neither God can be duly
glorified, not true good workes done</note> nor doe thoſe good workes which
may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit their neighbour. For thoſe workes that they apply them
ſelues vnto, are their owne inuentions, conſiſting in geſtures,
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, places, times, meates and ſuch like trifles, whereby their
neighbour can be holpen neither in body, nor minde, nor in any thinge els. For
what can it profit me that thy crowne is ſhauen very broad: that thou
weareſt a gray coule: what profit bringeth it, that thou faſteſt to day,
and keepeſt holy day to morrow: that thou abſtaineſt from this meate, and
eateſt that: that thou remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in this place: that thou readeſt and
mumbleſt vp daily ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wordes? Surely thou dooſt nothing els by
theſe, but torment thy ſelfe to pleaſe Satan, and to be a pernicious and
hurtfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to thy neighbours: for there is no Chriſtianitie in thy
life being ſuch. Thou beleeueſt not as it behoueth a Chriſtian to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and therefore neither dooſt thou pray Chriſtianly: Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
alſo is not true chaſtiſing of thy body, but raſhly taken vpon thee in
ſteede of a good worke: In a ſumme, this thy ſeruice and ſtudy of
religion is no other thing, then in time paſt amonge the Iewes was the
religion of Moloch and Baal, in the honour of whom they did kill and burne euen
their owne children. So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious and peſtilent an example is this thy
holines, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo goodly vnto thee, which when it meruelouſly
counterfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a ſhew of godlines, it draweth miſerable men to the
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and vtterly extinguiſheth true religion.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps ſome godly man will thinke: If the matter be ſo,
and our workes doe not ſaue vs, but onely to heare Chriſt and beleue in
him, who is giuen vnto vs of the Father to be our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and
ſaluation, to what ende then are ſo many precepts giuen vnto vs, and why
doth God ſo ſeuerely require that they be obeyed? The preſent text of the
Apoſtle ſhall giue vnto vs the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this queſtion, and vpon
this fit occaſion we will now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the expoſition thereof. The
Galathians being taught of Paule the faith of Chriſt, but afterwards
ſeduced by falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, thought that the matter of our ſaluation
muſt be finiſhed &amp; made perfect by the workes of the law, and that
onely faith doth not ſuffize. Theſe Paule calleth backe againe from workes
vnto faith with great diligence, and words meruelous effectual, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prouing that the workes of the law which goe before ſaith, doe make vs onely
ſeruaunts, and be of no importance to godlines &amp; <pb n="284" facs="tcp:9413:151"/>
ſaluation: but that faith doth make vs the ſonnes of God, &amp; that from
thence true good workes doe without conſtraint forth with moſt plentifully
flowe. But here we muſt accuſtom our ſelues to the wordes of the
Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Whom Paul calleth a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, and whom a
ſonne in the text which is here intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</note> He calleth him a
ſeruaunt that is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in workes without faith, whereof we haue already
intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at large: he calleth him a ſonne, which is righteous and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by faith alone, without workes. The reaſon hereof is this: this ſeruaunt,
although he apply him ſelfe to good workes, yet he doth it not with that
minde, with which a ſonne doth, that is with a minde that is free, willing,
&amp; certaine that the inheritance and all the good thinges of the Father are
his: but doth it as he that is hyred with a ſtipend in an other mans houſe,
who hopeth not that the inheritance ſhal come vnto him. The works in deede of
the ſonne and the ſeruaunt are like, &amp; almoſt all one according to
the outward appearance, but their mindes do differ exceeding much, and their
hope is nothing like, euen as Chriſt him ſelfe ſayth: <hi>The ſeruaunt
abideth not in the houſe for euer: but the ſonne abideth for euer.</hi>
Ioh. 8. Theſe of Cains broode want the faith of ſonnes, which they them
ſelues confeſſe for they thinke it a moſt abſurd thing, &amp; wicked
arrogancie, to affirme them ſelues to be the ſonnes of God and holy,
therefore as they beleeue, euen ſo are they counted before God, they neuer
become the ſonnes of God, or holy, neuertheles they are exerciſed with the
workes of the law, and are well wearied, wherefore they are and remaine
ſeruaunts for euer. And they receiue no other reward, but theſe temporall
things, namely, quietnes of life, aboundance of goods, dignitie and honours,
&amp;c. Which we ſee to be vſuall among the followers of Popiſh religion,
then whom there is none at this day that liueth more pleaſauntly, more
welthily, more gloriouſly and honorably. But this is their reward, they are
ſeruaunts and not ſonnes, wherefore in death they ſhall be thruſt from
all good thinges, neither ſhall any portion of eternall inheritance come vnto
them, who in this preſent life would beleeue nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So therefore
it is that ſeruaunts and ſonnes are not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in workes, but in
minde and faith they are moſt vnlike.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle endeuoureth here to proue, (which in deede is
the very matter) that the law with all the workes thereof doth make vs no other
then ſeruaunts, if this faith in Chriſt, whereof we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be away.
For that alone doth make vs the ſonnes <pb n="285" facs="tcp:9413:151"/> of God. Neither
the law nor nature can giue it, onely the Goſpel bringeth it, when it is
heard with an holy ſilence of minde. It is the word of grace, which the holy
Ghoſt doth forthwith followe, as it is ſhewed in very many places, and
ſpecially Act. 10: where we read, that the holy Ghoſt did by and by fall on
Cornelius and his familie hearing the preaching of Peter.<note place="margin">The
lawe why it was giuen.</note> Moreouer the lawe was giuen for this, that we
might learne by it, howe voyd we are of grace, and howe farre from being of the
minde of ſonnes, yea that we are plainly of a ſeruile minde. For we being
left to our ſelues, can in no wiſe be free from the lawe, neither if we doe
any good thing, doe we it willingly, foraſmuch as that faith of ſonnes is
wanting, wherwith he that is endued, knoweth aſſuredly, that the eternall
inheritance ſhall come vnto him, and is of his owne accord inclined and bent,
with a willing and ready ſpirit to doe thoſe thinges that are good. Nowe
theſe men doe willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they are void of this faith, and
if they would confeſſe the truth in deede, they ſhoulde alſo plainly
confeſſe, that they had farre rather be without all lawe, and that they are
againſt their wills ſubiect thereunto. Wherefore all thinges are among them
conſtrained, and void of faith, and they are in very deede compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to
confeſſe that by the lawe they can not attaine any further. Which one thing
they ought to learne by the law, and know, that they are ſeruaunts, and haue
nothing belonging to ſonnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be enflamed with deſire to
come from ſeruitude to the ſtate and condition of ſonnes: and might make
no account of their owne thinges, as in deede they ought to doe, that God of
his grace might aduaunce them vnto an other ſtate by faith. Nowe this were a
ſound vnderſtanding of the law, and the true vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereof this is
the office,<note place="margin">The office of the lawe.</note> to reproue and
conuince men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they are ſeruaunts and not ſonnes, as many as
follow the law without faith, and that they doe exerciſe themſelues therein
plainly againſt their wills, and with no confidence of grace. For it
cauſeth and maketh ſuch to be offended at it, and learne by it, how
vnprepared and vnwilling they are to that which is good, inaſmuch as they are
void of faith, whereby it moueth them to ſeeke helpe ſome other where, and
not to preſume of their owne ſtrength to ſatisfie it. For it requireth a
ready will, and hartes of ſonnes, which alone can ſatisfie it: it vtterly
refuſeth ſeruaunts, and them that be vnwilling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:9413:152"/>But theſe of Cains broode doe not onely of
their owne accord confeſſe, that they want this faith, which maketh the
ſonnes of God, but alſo they perſecute it: they feele and know alſo ful
wel, how vnwillingly they beare the lawe, and had rather to be free from it,
neuertheles they thinke that they ſhal become righteous by theſe their
vnwilling and conſtrained workes. They will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſeruaunts, &amp; will
not be chaunged into ſonnes, and yet they would enioy the goods of a
ſtraunge father. They do all thinges cleane out of order: wheras by the law
they ought to learne, that they are ſeruaunts, and vnwilling to doe that
which is good, and therefore ſhould by faith aſpire to the ſtate of
ſonnes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they goe ſo farre that they ſeeke to
ſatisfie and fulfill it by their owne works onely. And thereby they doe
altogither hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ende of the law, and ſtriue againſt faith and grace,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if they were not blind, the law would direct and driue them: And
ſo they continue alwayes, a blinde, blockiſh, and miſerable people.
Theſe thinges Paule teacheth Rom. 3. and 7. and doth freely pronounce that no
man is iuſtified before God by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> works of the lawe,<note place="margin">No
man is iuſtified by the lawe.</note> adding no other cauſe hereof, then
this, for that the knowledge of ſinne only commeth by the law. If thou wilt
know howe this commeth to paſſe, conſider well ſome one of Cains brood,
and thou ſhalt by and by ſee it verified. Firſt he worketh his workes
according to the lawe, with great griefe and labour, and yet he therewith
confeſſeth, that he is vncertaine whether he be the ſonne of God, and
holy. Yea he condemneth and curſeth this faith, as the moſt pernitious
arrogancie and errour of all other, and will continue in his douting, vntil he
be made certaine by his workes. Here thou ſeeſt plainly that ſuch a man
is not good or righteous, ſeeing that he wanteth this faith and beleefe, that
he is counted acceptable before God, and his ſonne, yea he is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of
this faith, and therefore of righteouſnes alſo: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither can his
workes be counted good, although they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a faire ſhew of fulfilling the
lawe. And thus is it eaſie to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which Paule ſayth: that no
man is iuſtified before God by the workes of the lawe. For the worker muſt
be iuſtified before God, before he worketh any good thing, although before
men, which eſteeme a man by outward thinges, and not by the mind, they are
counted righteous which apply them ſelues to the doing of good workes. For
men iudge the worker by the works, <pb n="287" facs="tcp:9413:152"/> God iudgeth the
workes by the worker. Nowe the firſt precept requireth, that we acknowledge
&amp; worſhip one God, that is, that we truſt and reſt in him alone,
which in deede is the true faith, whereby we become the ſonnes of God. But
how eaſie is it by this precept to know, that ſinne is both in him of Cains
brood, &amp; in thy ſelfe, inaſmuch as both of you want ſuch a faith,
euen by your owne nature? which thou couldeſt not know but by meanes of this
law. And this is that which Paul meaneth when he ſayth: <hi>That by the law
commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi>
3.20.</note> Now thou canſt be deliuered from this euill of infidelitie,
neither by thyne owne power, nor by the power of the lawe, wherefore all thy
workes whereby thou goeſt about to ſatisfie the lawe, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
workes of the lawe, of farre leſſe importance, then that they are able to
iuſtifie thee before God: who counteth them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous, which truly
beleeue in him, for they onely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him the true God, are his ſonnes,
and doe truely fulfill the law. But if thou ſhouldeſt euen kill thy ſelfe
with workes, yet is it ſo farre of, that thy hart can obtaine this faith
thereby, that thy workes are euen a hinderance that thou canſt not knowe it,
yea they are a cauſe that thou dooſt perſecute it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it is, that he that ſtudieth to fulfill the law without
faith, is afflicted for the deuils ſake, and not for Gods ſake, and
continueth a perſecutour both of faith and of the lawe, vntill he come to him
ſelfe, and doth plainly ceaſſe to truſt in him ſelfe and in his owne
workes, doth giue this glory vnto God, who iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vngodly,
acknowledgeth him ſelfe to be nothing, and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for God his grace,
whereof he doth now know, being taught by the law, that he hath neede. Then
faith and grace come, and fil him being emptie, ſatisfie him being hungry, by
and by follow good workes, which are truely good: Neither are they now the
workes of the law, but of the ſpirit, of faith and grace, and they are called
in the Scriptures the workes of God, which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in vs. For whatſoeuer
we do of our owne power &amp; ſtrength,<note place="margin">All that we doe of
our ſelues being not aſſiſted by the grace of God, is euill.</note> and
is not wrought in vs by his grace, without dout it is a worke of the law, and
auaileth nothing to iuſtification, but is both euill and hated of God,
becauſe of the infidelitie wherein it is done. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whatſoeuer he of
Cains brood worketh, he doth nothing from his hart, nothing freely and with a
willing mind, except he be as it were hyred with ſome reward, or be
commaunded to doe <pb n="288" facs="tcp:9413:153"/> ſome ſuch thinge, whereunto he
ought otherwiſe to be ready of him ſelfe: Euen as an euill and vnthriftie
ſeruaunt ſuffereth him ſelfe to be brought to no worke, vnles he be hyred
with a reward, or commaunded, whereunto he ought otherwiſe to be willing of
himſelfe. Nowe how vnpleaſaunt is it to a man to haue ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts?
But they of Cains brood be plainly ſuch, they would do no good worke at all,
if they were not either compelled by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of hell, or allured by the hope
of preſent good thinges. Whereby againe thou ſeeſt, that theſe haue no
mind to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, they gape on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for gaine, or are moued with feare, whereby
they bewray them ſelues, that they doe rather hate the law from their hart,
and had leuer that there were no law at all: Wherefore it is plainly
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they are not good, and conſequently that neither their
workes be good: for how ſhould euill men worke good workes? Moreouer thoſe
their workes, which in apparance &amp; ſhew ſeeme to be good, are either
wreſted from them by feare, or are bought with promiſes. An euill hart can
doe nothing that is good. But this naughtines of the hart &amp; vnwillingnes to
doe good, the lawe bewrayeth when it teacheth, that God doth not greatly
eſteeme, what the hand doth, but what the hart doth: which, ſeeing it
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the law that is good, who wil deny it to be moſt euill. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is
a ſinne to be againſt the lawe, which is very good. Thus therefore ſinne
is knowne by the lawe, according as Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, foraſmuch as we learne
thereby, howe our affection is not ſet on that which is good,<note place="margin">What the knowledge of ſinne which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the law, ought to
worke in vs.</note> which ought to terrifie vs, and driue vs to ceaſſe to
truſt in our ſelues, and to long after the grace of God, whereby this
naughtines of the hart may be taken away, and our mind may become ſuch, as is
of it ſelfe ready to good things, and loueth the lawe, which voluntarily, not
for any feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or reſpect of reward, but becauſe it doth
of it owne accord like well of the law, and loue righteouſnes, worketh
thoſe things which are truely good: By this meanes onely one is made of a
ſeruaunt a ſonne, of a ſlaue an heire. Which mind and ſpirit thou
ſhalt receiue by no other meanes, then by faith in Chriſt, as it is before
ſpoken at large. Now let vs come to entreat of the text of Paule.</p>

is.</note> For the Goſpell is no other thinge, then an open and generall
preaching of this grace, that in Chriſt bleſſing and grace is layde vp

before that this couenant is truly opened and made manifeſt to men, the
ſonnes of God liue after the maner of ſeruaunts vnder the lawe, and are
exerciſed with the workes of the law, although they can not be iuſtified by

euen then predeſtinate to life, when they are after the maner of ſeruaunts
helde vnder the lawe, they are true heires of heauenly good thinges, that is,
of this bleſſing and grace of this couenant: albeit they as yet doe not
know, or enioy it, but are wearied with workes no otherwiſe then other that
are voyde of fayth. So at this daye thou mayeſt finde not a fewe, which nowe
hauing faith, as they are the ſonnes of God, ſo doe they alſo enioye the
grace of God in the libertie of the ſonnes, when as a litle before being
drowned in workes, they knewe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge at all of faith, being in all thinges

for there is one Father, and the ſame God of all. Thou ſeeſt therefore
that Paul, as almoſt in all other places, ſo here alſo doth entreat much
of faith, that we are not iuſtified by our works, but by faith alone, whereby
not certaine good things by peecemeale, but all good thinges at once doe come

contayne in it, it giueth and bringeth righteouſnes, ſaluation, and God him

God is togither receiued. From thence alſo good workes doe come, howbeit not

vnwillingly they liue vnder the lawe, and that they doe no good at all with a

vnwilling minde: whereby they maye eaſily ſee, what is the roote of this
euill, and what is eſpecially needefull vnto ſaluation, to wit a newe and a
willing ſpirit to that which is good. Which ſurely neyther the lawe, nor
the workes of the lawe are able to giue, yea the lenger and the more that they
applye them ſelues vnto them, ſo much more vnwilling ſhall they finde
them ſelues, and with ſo muche more griefe to worke thoſe thinges that
are good. Hereupon nowe they learne, that they doe not ſatisfie the lawe,
although outwardly they liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript rule thereof: for as
they doe pretend to obeye it in worke, ſo in minde they doe hate it,
wherefore in <pb n="292" facs="tcp:9413:155"/> minde alſo they remayne ſinners,
although they pretende them ſelues righteous by workes, that is, they are
like vnto thoſe of Cains broode, and to hypocrites, whoſe hande in deede is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to good, but they haue a hart, which as it is an enemie to the lawe,
ſo doth it verely conſent vnto ſinnes, and is miſerably ſubiect vnto
them. To knowe this concerning them ſelues is not the loweſt degree to
ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Hereof alſo we may ſee, howe fitly Paule calleth ſuch
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned workes the workes of the lawe.<note place="margin">The workes of
the lawe.</note> For they flowe not from a ready and willing hart, but are
enforced by the lawe, the harte declyning an other waye. Howebeit the lawe
dothe not require workes alone, but muche rather the harte it ſelfe, ſo
that we might ſaye, not onely the workes, but rather the harte of the lawe:
not onely the handes of the lawe, but rather the mynde, will, and all the
ſtrength of the lawe. Whereupon it is ſayde in the firſt Pſalme of the
bleſſed man: <hi>But his delight is in the lawe of God, and in his lawe
doth he exerciſe him ſelfe daye and night.</hi> Suche a mynde the lawe
requireth in deede, but it giueth it not, neyther can it giue it of it owne
nature, whereby it commeth to paſſe that whyle the lawe continueth to exact
it of a man, and to condemne him as longe as he hath not ſuche a minde, as
diſobedient to God, he is in anguiſh on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, his conſcience is
grieuouſly terrified and without all counſell and helpe. Then in deede he

ſelfe wholly to praye to the Father for grace, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth his

and doth altogither, as it is meete, humble him ſelfe, perceiuing nowe full
well, that betweene him and a manifeſt ſinner there is no difference at all
but of workes, that he hath a wicked harte, euen as euery other ſinner hath.
Yea it may be that ſuch hypocrites doe farre more hate the lawe in their
harte, then thoſe famous ſinners, which are euen as it were drowned in
ſinnes. For whyle theſe are euen weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the workes of ſinnes, and

               <p>Moreouer foraſmuch as the condition of mans nature is ſuch,

to ſinne: the ſhell to God, and the kernell to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. So that commeth to
paſſe which is in the Goſpell, that the wickedneſſes of him, which is
in thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a deſperat ſinner, are counted as a mote, and thine, which

hereunto, that ſuch hypocrites doe not ſee a beame in their eye, but being
blinded doe perſeuer in their accuſtomed workes, not marking this their
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abhomination of the hart, they by and by burſt forth to iudge &amp;
condemne others, they deſpiſe ſinners, as he did in the Goſpell, they
thinke them ſelues not like vnto them, they are not as other men are, they
thinke them ſelues alone godly and righteous. Whoſe vngodlines if one
reproue, &amp; as it is meete, bewray, they by and by are in a rage and furie,

heretikes, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemers, them which be ſeduced &amp; doe ſeduce with

of the world,<note place="margin">The rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world why ſo
called.</note> for that all that obſeruing of the lawe, which men not yet
renued by the ſpirit doe performe, doth conſiſt in worldly thinges, to
wit, in places, times, apparell, perſons, veſſells, and ſuch like. But
faith reſteth in no worldly thinge, but in the onely grace, worde, and mercy
of God, neither doth it make a man righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſafe by any outward thing,
but onely by the inuiſible and eternall grace of God: Wherefore it counteth a
like, dayes, meates, perſons, apparell, and all thinges of this worlde. For
none of theſe by it ſelfe doth eyther further or hinder godlines &amp;
ſaluation, as it doth the righteouſnes of thoſe of Cains brood, which is
as it were tyed to theſe outward thinges. Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerueth
nothing leſſe then to be called the rudiments of the worlde, by which we
obtayne the fulnes of heauenly good thinges: and albeit it be occupied alſo
in outward thinges, yet is it addicted to no outward thinge, but doth freely in
all thinges that which it ſeeth may be done to the glorie of God, and profit
of our neighbours, alwayes continuing free and the ſame, and yet is made all
thinges to all men, that ſo the conuerſation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may want all peculiar
reſpecte and difference. With thoſe of Cains brood it agreeth neyther in
name, nor in any thinge: one of them eateth fleſh, an other abſtayneth from
it: one wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth blacke apparell, an other white: one keepeth this day ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
an other that: euery one hath his rudiments, vnder which he is in bondage: all
of them are addicted to the thinges of the world, which are frayle and periſh
in an houre. Wherefore they are no other but ſeruaunts of the rudiments of
the worlde, which they call holy orders, godly ordinaunces, and wayes to goe to
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Againſt theſe Paule ſpeaketh Coloſ. 2: <hi>VVherefore if ye be
deade with Chriſt from the rudiments of the worlde, why as though ye liued in
the worlde, are ye burdened with traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? As, Touch not, Taſt not, Handle
not: which all perish with the vſing, and are after the commaundements and

diſagree with the Goſpel <pb n="296" facs="tcp:9413:157"/> and Chriſtian libertie,
and that therefore it is much more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to liue in theſe kindes of
life, then among moſt prophane men. For all their things are nothing but
rudiments &amp; ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world, conſiſting in the difference and
vſe of apparell, places, times, and other preſent thinges, whereunto
ſeeing they are ſo addicted, that they hope by them to attaine
righteouſnes &amp; ſaluation, faith is made no account of amongeſt them,
neither are they Chriſtians, but in name, wherefore all their life and
holines is meere ſinne, and moſt deteſtable hypocriſie.</p>

to theſe ordinaunces, that they be not too much addicted vnto them, but that
they doe perſeuer in a free faith, which is tyed to none of thoſe outward

life &amp; fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holines, which is in thoſe ordinaunces, doth with a
merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſecret force withdraw from faith, more then thoſe
mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and groſſe ſinnes, wherof open ſinners are gilty, and doth
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily make men ſuch as Paule here ſpeaketh of: <hi>VVhen we were

alone taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and teacheth vs to truſt vnto, and reſt vpon the onely
grace of God, whereby at once is giuen freely that which is needefull to worke

               <p>After Paule hath taught, that righteouſnes and faith can not 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:9413:157"/> come to vs by the Law, neither that we can deſerue it
by nature, he ſheweth him by whom we obtaine true righteouſnes &amp; faith,
and which is the author of our iuſtification. Now this could not come vnto vs
without any price, for it coſt a verie great price, euen the ſonne of God:
The Apoſtle therefore ſayth:<note place="margin">The fulnes of time how it is
to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</note> 
                  <hi>When the fulnes of time was come,</hi> that is,
when the time was ended, that time, I ſay, wherein it behoued vs to liue
children and ſeruaunts vnder the diſcipline of the Lawe. Wherefore the
Maiſter of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences hath erred here, who interpreted the fulnes of time,
the time of grace, which began at the birth of Chriſt, plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to
the Apoſtle, who whereas he hath written, the fulnes of time, this man hath
interpreted it, the time of fulnes. For Paul ſpeaketh of the time, which was
appointed of the father to the ſonne, wherein he ſhould liue vnder tuters.
Now as this time was full come to the Iewes and ended, when Chriſt came in
the fleſh, ſo is it daily fulfilled to others, when they come vnto the
knowledge of Chriſt, and do chaunge the ſeruitude of the Lawe with the
faith of the ſonnes. And this in deede is that comming, whereby alone we
obtaine the libertie of ſonnes, without which that corporall comming would
auaile nothing. For Chriſt euen for this cauſe hath come vnto vs, that
beleeuing in him, we may be reſtored to true libertie, by which faith they of
the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time alſo obtained the libertie of the ſpirit. And ſo,
whereas he ſhould come to the holy men of olde time, he came euen then,
foraſmuch as by faith they felt him to be their true Sauiour and deliuerer,
howbeit he is not yet come to our Iewes, although he is gone awaye againe in
body long ſince: for they do not beleeue in him. All from the beginning of
the world to the end muſt truſt vnto the comming of Chriſt, whereby alone
ſeruitude is chaunged with libertie, but yet by fayth, either in Chriſt
being to come, as it was before he was borne: or in him being come, as it is
now. Wherefore as ſoone as thou beginneſt to beleeue in Chriſt, he
commeth vnto thee a deliuerer and Sauiour, &amp; now the time of bondage is
ended, that is, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, the fulnes thereof is come.</p>
               <p>This place ſurely is verie copious, and containeth in it
diuers thinges moſt worthie to be knowne, ſo that I greatly feare, that it
ſhall not be handled of vs according to the worthines thereof. For it
teacheth that it is not ſufficient to beleeue that Chriſt is 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:9413:158"/> come, but that we muſt alſo beleeue that he was
ſent of God, is the ſonne of God, and alſo verie man, borne of a Virgine,
who alone hath fulfilled the Lawe, and that not for himſelfe, but for vs,
that is, for our ſaluations ſake. Let vs wey and conſider theſe thinges
in order. Firſt it is ſufficiently taught in the Goſpell of Iohn, that
Chriſt is the ſonne of God, and was ſent of God, which he that beleeueth
not is in a moſt miſerable caſe, as Chriſt himſelfe pronounceth Ioh.
8: <hi>Except ye beleeue that I am he, ye shall dye in your ſynnes.</hi> And
Ioh. 1: <hi>In it was life, and that life was the light of men.</hi> For this
cauſe the mynde of man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may nor ought to enioy any other thing then
that ſoueraigne good, ſo, that it ſhould be ſatiſfied with any other
then with it, whereof it was made, and which is the fountaine of all good
thinges: wherefore it is not the will of God that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue or
repoſe our truſt in any other thing, neither doth this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belong to
any other. And therefore God himſelfe ioyned himſelfe to man,<note place="margin">Why it was requiſite that God ſhould be made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> being
made man, that he might more forcibly allure men into him, and ſtirre them vp
to beleeue in him. No good could come vnto God hereby, but it was
neceſſarie for vs that he ſhould be made man, leſt that we ſhould
beleeue in any other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in God alone. For if we ſhould beleeue in
Chriſt, and not in God, as God ſhould be depriued of his honour, ſo
ſhould we be depriued of life and ſaluation. For we muſt beleeue in one
God, who is the verie truth, and we without him can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liue, nor obtaine
ſaluation. Whereas therefore the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>God ſent forth his
Sonne,</hi> it is thereby manifeſt, that he was, before he came and was made
man. Now if he be a ſonne, he is more then a man or an Angell, which ſeeing
they are the higheſt creatures, ſurely he is alſo true God. For to be the
ſonne of God is more then to be an Angell, as it is els where declared.
Againe,<note place="margin">Chriſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſon from the
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> ſeeing that he is ſent of God, and is his ſonne, he
muſt needes be an other perſon. And ſo the Apoſtle teacheth here, that
the Father and the Sonne are one God, and two perſons. Of the holy Ghoſt it
ſhalbe ſpoken hereafter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which ought here to be conſidered, is, that
Chriſt is verie man and the ſonne of man. This Paul teacheth, when he
ſayth:<note place="margin">Chriſt verie man.</note> 
                  <hi>made of a woman.</hi>
For ſurely that that is made or borne of a woman, is man: A woman by nature
bringeth forth nothing but verie man. This it is neceſſarie that we beleeue
as <pb n="299" facs="tcp:9413:158"/> the Lord himſelfe declareth Ioh. 6, in theſe
wordes: <hi>Except ye eate the flesh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his
blood, ye haue no life in you.</hi> But to eate and drinke his fleſh and
blood,<note place="margin">What it is to eat &amp; drinke the fleſh and blood
of Chriſt.</note> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but to beleeue, that Chriſt tooke theſe
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in deed, and did alſo yeeld them to death for our ſake. This is
that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt which was promiſed to Abraham: <hi>In thy ſeede shall all
the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Gen. 22. Chriſt is this
ſeede, and therefore the true ſonne of Abraham, his fleſh and blood.
Hereupon it appeareth that they preuaile nothing,<note place="margin">We muſt
come vnto God by Chriſt.</note> which make a proper waye vnto themſelues to
God, by their owne workes and godlines, and neglecting Chriſt ſtriue to
come directly vnto God, as the Turkes and Iewes doe. This Chriſt alone is the
mediatour &amp; bleſſed ſeede, by whom thou muſt receiue bleſſing,
otherwiſe thou ſhalt continue for euer in malediction. This coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
God ſhal not be violated of becauſe any. Thus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth,
Ioh. 6: <hi>No man commeth to the Father, but by me.</hi> The nature of God is
otherwiſe higher, then that we are able to attaine vnto it, wherefore he hath
humbled himſelfe to vs, and taken vpon him that nature, which is beſt
knowne and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar vnto vs, to wit, euen our owne. Here he looketh for
vs: here he will receiue vs: he that will ſeeke him here, ſhall fynde: he
that will aſke here ſhall be heard: here is the throne of grace and the
true mercy ſeate, from which none is driuen or thruſt which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true faith
reſorteth vnto it. They which do here neglect him, as though he were made man
for nought, and in the meane ſeaſon do without a mediatour praie vnto God,
who hath created heauen and earth, they ſhall pray in deede, but none ſhall
helpe them: they ſhall crie, but none ſhall heare them.</p>
               <p>The third thing which is here ſet forth vnto vs to beleeue,
is, that Marie the mother of Ieſus is a virgine.<note place="margin">The mother
of Ieſus a Virgine.</note> This Paule affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth when he ſayth, that he was
made of a woman, not of a man, as other are wont. This is that one man, which
was borne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a woman. He would not ſay, of a virgine,<note place="margin">Why Paule rather ſaide that Chriſt was made of a woman, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of a virgine.</note> for that a virgine is not a name of nature, but a woman
ſignifieth a ſex and certein condition, whereunto it belongeth to be with
childe, and to bring forth, that is, to do the partes of a mother. Seeing
therefore that Marie was a mother in deede, ſhe is rightly called a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For ſhe brought forth fruite vnto vs, which belongeth to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not
to a virgin, although ſhe brought it forth alone, <pb n="300" facs="tcp:9413:159"/>
without the meanes of man, wherein ſhe was declared both a ſingular virgin
and woman. But becauſe it is of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce to the Apoſtle, and
vnto all vs, that Marie is a woman, and thereby the mother of Chriſt, then
that ſhe is a virgine, for that this is onely an ornament vnto her, but in
that ſhe was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhe brought forth him which is ſaluation vnto all,
for this cauſe I ſay, the Apoſtle calleth her rather a woman then a
vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Neither was it conſidered in chooſing her, that ſhe was a
virgine, but that ſhe was a woman: for that ſhe being a virgine became a
mother,<note place="margin">Why it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of Chriſt ſhould
be a virgine.</note> the cauſe was, for that it behoued that Chriſt
ſhould be borne without ſynne, and therefore without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of
man. For of the ſeede of a ſinfull man, nothing could be borne, but that
which is defiled with ſynne: but it behoued that Chriſt ſhould be that
bleſſed ſeede, whoſe bleſſing ſhould be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth vpon all,
as the maner of the diuine couenant required. Whereupon it is gathered, that
Chriſt could not be borne of the ſeede of man, for that all men are by
nature vnder the curſe. For how ſhould bleſſing be promiſed to come
vnto all by Chriſt, if all were not ſubiect to the curſe?</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch then as the couenant of God promiſed to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
did require theſe two thinges, both that Chriſt ſhould be the true
ſonne of Abraham, that is, his ſeede, his true fleſh and blood, &amp;
that alſo he ſhould be borne pure from ſynne: this meane was inuented,
that he ſhould of Marie being verie woman and the daughter of Abraham, be
borne verie man, and the right of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Abraham: and alſo that he
ſhould be borne without the commixtion of man, a virgine being conceiued with
child by the onely meanes of the holy Ghoſt, that being full of bleſſing,
he might deriue the ſame vnto all beleeuers. So was the couenant of God
fulfilled on either ſide: and it came to paſſe, that Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
both the true ſeede of Abraham, and yet free from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of Adam, and
is alſo the author of eternall bleſſing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beleeue. Wherefore
although Marie be holily to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by the name of virgine, yet by no
compariſon greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence is due vnto her then by the name of woman, for
that her moſt holy members, inaſmuch as ſhe was a woman, were aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vnto this dignitie, that they were as meanes toward the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the holy
couenant of God, and by them he was brought forth, which was to put awaye all
curſe from them that beleeue <pb n="301" facs="tcp:9413:159"/> in him, that ſo he
might be both the bleſſed ſeede of Abraham, and the bleſſed frute of
the wombe of Marie. Vnto which bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the onely virginitie had not bin
ſufficient, yea it had bin euen vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing whereof the preſent place of the Apoſtle
doth admoniſh vs, is, that Chriſt hath ſatiſfied the Lawe for vs. Which
he alſo witneſſeth of himſelfe Matth. 5: <hi>I am not come to
deſtroye the Lawe, but to fulfill it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that chriſt ſhould fulfill the Lawe for vs.</note> This alſo the reaſon
of the couenant requireth: for if by this ſeede of Abraham all men muſt be
deliuered from the curſe, it is neceſſarie that by it the Lawe be
fulfilled. For as men are by nature the children of wrath, and ſubiect to the
curſe, ſo it muſt needes be accurſed, whatſoeuer they doe, for it is
before proued at large, that he which is euell himſelfe, can worke nothing
that is good: likewiſe that we can do nothing that God will approue, vnles we
our ſelues be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him before: and ſeeing that the Lawe requireth
the heart, which can not be performed of them, which are not as yet rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
by the ſpirit, it muſt needes be, that all the ſonnes of Adam are giltie
of tranſgreſſing the Lawe, and vnles, whereas they themſelues are not
able, an other, to wit Chriſt, ſhould performe that which the Lawe
requireth, and ſo ſatiſfie the Law for them, they ſhould altogither
periſh by the curſe of the Law. But when as Chriſt, going about to
ſhewe, that the heart is required of the Lawe, did condemne the workes which
proceeded not from a heart that is godly and conſenting vnto the Lawe, he was
accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Phariſees that he was come to deſtroie the Lawe.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therefore he would take awaye this falſe opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he ſayd: <hi>Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the Lawe, for I am not
come to deſtroie, but to fulfill the Lawe:</hi> yea and I will giue a
ſpirit vnto them that be mine, which ſhal iuſtifie their heart by faith,
and incline it vnto true good workes. The ſame is vſuall with Paul alſo,
who, Rom. 3, when he had reiected the workes of the Lawe, and extolled faith,
aunſwering ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, ſaith: <hi>Do we then make the Lawe of
none effect? God forbid: yea we eſtablish the Lawe.</hi> For we teach that
the true fulfilling of the Lawe is by Chriſt. The like alſo is wont to be
obiected to vs, as though we did forbid good workes, when we diſallow
monaſteries with their workes, &amp; teach that they muſt firſt by faith
become good and approued of God, whereby they <pb n="302" facs="tcp:9413:160"/> may
afterward do true good workes, by which both their fleſh may be
chaſtiſed, and their neighbours edified.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt note moreouer, that the Lawe can be fulfilled of
no man, but of him which being free from the Lawe, is no more vnder it. We
muſt accuſtome our ſelues alſo to the maner of Paules ſpeeche, that
we may know aſſuredly who is vnder the Lawe,<note place="margin">Who be
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</note> and who is not vnder the Lawe. As many therefore as
worke good workes, becauſe the Lawe hath ſo commaunded, being brought
thereunto either with feare of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or hope of reward, are vnder the
Lawe, and are compelled to do good thinges and to be honeſt, being not
brought hereunto of their owne voluntarie will. Wherefore the Lawe hath
dominion ouer them, whoſe ſeruaunts and captiues they are. Now ſuch are
all men, that are not yet regenerate by Chriſt, which euerie one may eaſily
learne with himſelfe by experience, euerie mans own conſcience ſhewing it
vnto him. We all finde our ſelues ſo affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if no Lawe did vrge
vs, &amp; both the feare of puniſhment, and hope of reward were awaye, and it
were plainly free for vs to do what we liſt, we would do altogether thoſe
thinges that are euell, and omit the thinges that are good, eſpecially either
ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation mouing vs, or occaſion prouoking vs. But now, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the
Law ſtayeth vs with the threatninges and promiſes thereof, we do oftentimes
abſtaine from euell thinges, and do thoſe thinges that be good, howbeit we
do them not for the loue of goodnes, and hatred of euel, but onely for feare of
puniſhment, and reſpect of reward: wherefore being left wholy to our
ſelues, we are ſeruaunts of the Lawe, neither do we heare it any
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then ſeruaunts do their hard and cruell maiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">They which are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lawe
deſcribed, of what ſort they be.</note>But they that are not vnder the
Lawe, that is, are not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills in ſubiection vnder the
dominion thereof, they of their owne accord do good workes, and abſtaine from
euell, being neither terrified with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> threatninges of the Law, nor allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the promiſes thereof, but euen for that they do of their voluntarie will
beare a loue to honeſtie, and hate that which is diſhoneſt, and are
alſo from their heart delighted with the Lawe of God, ſo that if there were
no Lawe made, notwithſtanding they would deſire to liue no otherwiſe then
the Lawe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: as, to ſhun thoſe thinges that be euell, and applie
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to honeſt ſtudies and exerciſes. They that are ſuch, are 
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:9413:160"/> ſonnes, whom not nature, but that onely bleſſed
ſeede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, that is, Chriſt, could make ſuch, renuing by his grace
and ſpirit the heartes of them that beleeue in him.<note place="margin">What it
is, not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</note> Wherefore not to be vnder the Lawe, is
not, to be free from the Lawe, that they may do thoſe things that are
contrarie thereunto, and omit thoſe thinges that are good, but it is to do
good thinges and abſtaine from wicked thinges, not through compulſion or
neceſſitie of the Lawe, but by free loue and with pleaſure, euen as if no
Law commaunded them, and their owne nature brought them hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as in deede
it doth, howbeit the new nature of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">A
ſimilitude.</note> not that olde nature of the fleſh. For as there is neede
of no Lawe for the body, which may compell it to eate, to drinke, to
digeſt,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> to ſleepe; to go, to
ſtand, to ſit, and to do the other workes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that it is ready
to do them of it owne nature, when the caſe ſo requireth, and when it is
meete, without all reſpect either of reward or puniſhment: and may not
vnfitly be ſaid, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe thinges, not to be vnder a law,
notwithſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon nothing leſſe foloweth, then that it doth
therefore abſtaine from ſuch workes, vnto which in deede it ſo much more
applieth if ſelfe as they are leſſe commaunded, and are more naturall
vnto it: After the ſame ſort altogither doth the godly man behaue
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concerning the workes of godlines, he is caried to the doing of
them by that his new nature of the ſpirit, albeit there were no lawe at all,
and all both hope of reward, and feare of puniſhment were awaye. This onely
is the true libertie of a Chriſtian man, and the deliueraunce of him from the
lawe, whereof Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 1. Tim. 1: <hi>The Lawe is not giuen vnto a
righteous man.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid: A righteous man of
his owne accord doth good thinges, and abſtaineth from euell, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no
regard either of reward or of puniſhment. The ſame thing alſo he meaneth
by that ſaying Rom. 6: <hi>Ye are not vnder the Lawe, but vnder Grace,</hi>
that is, ye are ſonnes, not ſeruaunts: Ye liue holily, being compelled or
enforced with nothing, but of your free and of it ſelfe ready will. To the
ſame effect pertaineth that ſaying alſo Rom. 8: <hi>Ye haue not receiued
the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to feare againe, but ye haue receiued the Spirit of
adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſonnes.</hi> The Lawe maketh a fearfull, that is, a right
ſeruile and cainiſh ſpirit, but Grace giueth the free ſpirit of
ſonnes, like vnto Abels, by Chriſt the bleſſed ſeede of Abraham. 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:9413:161"/> Whereof the 51. Pſalme ſpeaketh: <hi>Stablish me
with thy free ſpirit.</hi> Whereupon in the 118. Pſalme Chriſtian people
are ſaid to be of a free will.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Chriſt hath ſo fulfilled the Lawe, that he onely of
all mankynde hath of his owne accord ſatiſfied it, being with no thing
compelled or enforced thereunto, neither is any other able to do the ſame,
vnles he receiue it of him, and by him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul ſaith here:
<hi>He was made vnder the Lawe, that he might redeeme them, which were vnder
the Lawe.</hi> The fifte thing therefore that Paul here commendeth vnto vs to
be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt was made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</note>
is, that Chriſt for our ſake was made vnder the Lawe, that he might deliuer
vs from the bondage of the Law, and of vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſeruaunts make vs free
ſonnes: whereupon he ſaith: <hi>That he might redeeme them which were vnder
the Lawe,</hi> that is, might deliuer them from the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now he deliuereth
from the Lawe by the meanes aforeſaid, not by deſtroying or vtterly
abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Lawe,<note place="margin">How Chriſt deliuereth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Law.</note> but by fulfilling it, and giuing a free ſpirit, which ſhall do
all thinges willingly, without any reſpect either of the threatninges or the
promiſes of the Lawe, no otherwiſe then if there were no lawe at all giuen,
and is caried thereunto of his owne nature. After which ſort Adam and Eue
were effected before they had ſynned.<note place="margin">How the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of
libertie is obtained.</note> But by what meanes is this ſpirit giuen &amp;
libertie gotten? No otherwiſe then by faith. For he that truly beleeueth,
that Chriſt came for this cauſe, that he might deliuer vs from the Lawe,
and that he hath deliuered him already, he, I ſay, hath in deede receiued the
ſpirit of libertie, and doth verily obtaine that which he beleeueth: for both
faith and this ſpirit of ſonnes come togither. Whereupon Paul ſayth here:
that Chriſt hath deliuered vs from the Lawe, for this, that we might receiue
the adoption of the ſonnes: both which come vnto vs by faith. Thus therefore
we haue thoſe fiue thinges, whereof Paul admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed vs in this ſo
plentifull and fruitfull a place.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A queſtion.</note>But here riſeth a
queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Foraſmuch as to be vnder the Law, is to be ſubiect to the Lawe
by compulſion, and to obey the Law no otherwiſe then vnwillingly, ſo that
none of them which are vnder the Lawe, are able to ſatiſfie the Lawe, why
Paul ſayth, that Chriſt was made vnder the Lawe.<note place="margin">The
anſwer.</note> I aunſwere, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle maketh a verie great
differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene Chriſt, who was made vnder the Lawe,<note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between Chriſtes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder the Law &amp;
ours.</note> and other men which are borne vnder the <pb n="305" facs="tcp:9413:161"/>
Lawe. For whereas he ſayth that Chriſt was made vnder the Lawe, he would
ſignifie, that Chriſt did put himſelfe vnder the Lawe of his owne accord,
and was with his will made ſubiect vnto it of the Father, when as he might
not haue bin vnder the Lawe. But we were vnder the Lawe, being the ſeruaunts
of the Lawe by nature, and bearing the dominion thereof vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly: as
Chriſt was willingly, not by nature, and againſt his will. Wherefore there
is as great difference betweene,<note place="margin">It is one thing, to be made
vnder the Lawe, &amp; an other to be vnder the Lawe by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> To be
made vnder the Lawe, and, To be vnder the Lawe by nature, as betweene theſe,
To be ſubiect to the Lawe of free will, and, To be ſubiect to the Lawe by
ſeruile conſtraint. It was free vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Chriſt, to be vnder the Law, or not
to be vnder it, and he made himſelfe ſubiect to it of his owne accord, that
he might moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently do all thinges that the Law requireth: but we were
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lawe, euen againſt our will.</p>
               <p>Thou mayſt ſee a reſemblaunce hereof in Peter,<note place="margin">Ours, and Chriſts being vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law, and our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame moſt excellently reſembled.</note> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell which
came into the priſon to Peter to deliuer him. Both of them were then in the
priſon, but Peter was there being caſt in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to it of Herode, not of his owne
accord, wherein he was alſo to abide, for he could not go forth when he
would. But the Angell went into the priſon of his owne accord, whereupon it
was free for him alſo to go forth when he would: he was there onely for
Peters ſake and not for his owne, and freely euen at his owne will, whom when
Peter heard and folowed, it was free for him alſo to go forth of the
priſon, whereas before it was not. This priſon is the Lawe: Peter is our
conſcience: The Angell is Chriſt. Chriſt being abſent, our conſcience
is held captiue of the Lawe, and being vnwilling of it ſelfe, is moued vnto
good thinges by the threatninges and promiſes thereof, and is tied and bound
vnto honeſt thinges with theſe, as with two chaines. The keepers of this
priſon are the teachers of the Lawe, which declare the force of the Lawe vnto
vs. So we being bound in the priſon of the Lawe, Chriſt commeth vnto vs,
and willingly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe ſubiect to the Lawe, and doth the workes of
the Lawe of his owne accord, which we did bend our ſelues to do againſt our
wills, yea and doth them for our ſake, that he may ioyne vs vnto him, and
alſo bring vs out togither with himſelfe. For he may eaſily go forth, who
is held in the priſon by no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. If now we cleaue vnto him, and
follow him, we alſo do <pb n="306" facs="tcp:9413:162"/> goe forth. But this cleauing to
him and following him is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, then to beleeue in him, and not to dout
that he became man, and was made ſubiect to the lawe for thy ſaluations
ſake. Togither with this fayth commeth the ſpirit, he by and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
thee ready and willing to do with pleaſure all thinges that the Lawe
requireth: and ſo truly deliuereth thee from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of the Lawe,
thoſe chaines of threatninges and promiſes fall of from thee, and thou
mayſt now go whither thou liſt, that is, thou mayſt liue according to
thine owne will, or rather accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wil of the holy Ghoſt ruling all
thinges in thee: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what good thinges ſoeuer thou doeſt, thou doeſt
them from the heart, and with great pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt made vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law after two
ſorts.</note>Moreouer, that it may be made more plaine, after what ſort
Chriſt made himſelfe ſubiect to the Lawe, we muſt vnderſtand that he
was made vnder the Lawe after two ſorts: both for that he did perfectly
performe the workes of the Lawe, and alſo for that he ſuffered and ouercame
the curſe and puniſhment thereof for our ſake. For he was circumciſed,
preſented in the temple, and the time of the purification being finiſhed,
was obedient to his parents. All which thinges he might haue omitted, being
Lord of the Lawe, and ouer all: Howbeit he applied himſelfe to theſe
thinges freely of his owne will, not being either compelled by any feare, or
allured by any hope. In outward workes he was in the meane ſeaſon
altogether like vnto them which were vnder the Law, that is, which did the
workes of the Law againſt their wills, inaſmuch as his free ſpirit was
hidden from others, euen as alſo the ſeruile and conſtrained will of
others is hidden. And ſo he both was vnder the Lawe, and not vnder the Lawe.
He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe outwardly in workes as they which are vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly held
vnder the Lawe, whereas notwithſtanding he was not vnder the Lawe as they,
but of his owne free will: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reſpect of his worke he was vnder
the Lawe, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his will he was free from the Lawe.<note place="margin">How we are vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law.</note> But we as well by will as by
workes are vnder the Lawe by nature, for that we do workes according to the
rule of the Lawe, of neceſſitie, yea and we do them with that will which
the Lawe conſtraineth and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, in aſmuch as we do not endeuour to do
them of our owne accord. Chriſt made himſelfe ſubiect to the puniſhment
of the Lawe alſo for our ſakes of his owne will. He did not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:9413:162"/> thoſe workes which the Lawe commaundeth, but he
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the puniſhment alſo which was due to vs being
tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof. The Lawe condemneth to death and the eternall
curſe all thoſe that continue not in all thinges that are written in the
booke of the Lawe to do them, as Paule Gal. 3. reciteth out of Moſes Leuit.
18. Now it is declared at large before, that the Lawe is fulfilled of no man,
but that all men are againſt their willes held captiues of the Law, wherefore
euerie one is ſubiect to death and to the curſe, ſo that there is no man
ſubiect to the Lawe in reſpect of workes, and will, which is not alſo
ſubiect to it in reſpect of the curſe. For it curſeth and condemneth
all that do not performe it with their whole heart. But here Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
interceſſion for them that be his, and the iudgement which we haue
deſerued, he taketh vpon himſelfe, he ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due vnto
vs, willingly making himſelfe ſubiect to death and the curſe, that is, to
eternall damnation, no otherwiſe then if he had tranſgreſſed the whole
Lawe, and had more then all, deſerued the ſentence thereof againſt
tranſgreſſours, when as he did not onely not breake the Lawe, but
himſelfe alone fulfilled it, yea and fulfilled it when as he ought nothing to
it, ſo that he ſuffered otherwiſe then he deſerued in two reſpects:
both for that he had ought nothing to the Lawe, if he had not obſerued it,
and alſo for that moreouer he moſt diligently obſerued it, ſo that if
the Law had had eſpeciall dominion ouer him, yet had he come in no daunger
thereof. But on the other ſide whereas we ſuffer, we ſuffer by double
right: both for that by the tranſgreſſion of the Lawe we haue deſerued
all the puniſhment thereof, &amp; alſo for that, if we had deſerued
nothing, yet being creatures we ought to be obedient to the will of our
Creator.</p>
               <p>Hereof it now plainly appeareth, what this meaneth, that
Chriſt was made vnder the Lawe,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt was made
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</note> that he might redeeme them which liue vnder the lawe:
for our ſakes, for our ſakes, I ſay, and not for his owne he performed
that, and that of no neceſſitie, but of his great loue toward vs: and
thereby he hath declared his vnſpeakeable both goodnes and mercy toward vs,
being made accurſed for vs, that he might deliuer vs from the curſe of the
lawe. He willingly made himſelfe ſubiect to the iudgement of the lawe,
&amp; did himſelfe beare the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce pronounced againſt vs, that as many
of vs as do beleeue in him, might be free for euer. <pb n="308" facs="tcp:9413:163"/>
Whereby marke what an incomparable treaſure faith bringeth vnto thee,<note place="margin">By fayth we enioy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable treaſure.</note> whereby thou
enioyeſt Chriſt and all his workes, that thou mayſt truſt vnto them no
otherwiſe then if thou thy ſelfe hadſt done them. For Chriſt did them
not for himſelfe, whom ſurely they could profit nothinge, he hauing no
neede of any thinge, but by them he layd vp the treaſure of ſaluation for
vs, whereunto we ſhould truſt, and being made bleſſed might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye it:
With which fayth alſo the ſpirit of the ſonnes commeth, which beareth
witnes with our ſpirit, that we are the ſonnes and heires of God. What
ſhould God nowe adde vnto theſe? How can a mynde hearing theſe thinges
containe it ſelfe, that it ſhould not loue God againe with a moſt ardent
affection, and be moſt ſweetely delighted in him? What in any wiſe maye
come to be done or ſuffered, which thou wouldeſt not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take vpon
thee with exceeding ioye, and moſt high prayſe of God, with a reioycing and
triumphing mynde? Which mynde if thou wanteſt, it is a certaine argument of a
faint or ſurely a dead fayth: for the greater thy fayth is, ſo much more
ready alſo and willinge is thy mynde to thoſe thinges, which God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſendeth or commaundeth. This in deede is the true deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce from the
Lawe, and the damnation of the Lawe, that is, from ſynne and death, which
deliueraunce commeth to vs by Chriſt. Yet not ſo, that there is nowe no
lawe or death, but that they do not now trouble the beleeuers any thinge, that
is, they are as though they were not. For the Lawe can not conuince them of
ſynne, neither can death confound them: but by fayth they moſt happily
paſſe from ſynne and death to righteouſnes and life.</p>
               <p>Here Munkes, Nunnes &amp;c: were to be exhorted if there were as
yet left any place with them for counſell and admonition, that they would
obſerue their ordinaunces,<note place="margin">How mens ordinances, ceremonies
&amp;c. are to be obſerued.</note> ceremonies, prayers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and ſuch
like, as Chriſt obſerued the lawe, by which meanes ſurely they ſhould
bring vnto them no damnation: That is, that they would ſet the faith of
Chriſt in the firſt place, and commit the rule of their heart vnto him,
acknowledgeing that by that fayth onely they do obtaine righteouſnes and
ſaluation: and that all their ordinaunces &amp; workes do auaile nothing
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Againe that they would make themſelues ſubiect to them of their
owne accord, in no other reſpect, then that by them they 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:9413:163"/> might ſerue their neighbours, and ſubdue the
arrogancie of the fleſh. But now ſeing they are occupied in them with this
double erroneous opinion, as though they were neceſſarie to ſaluation and
righteouſnes, and if they did not obſerue them, they ſhould grieuouſly
ſynne, they are vnto them a moſt certaine deſtruction, nothing but
deluſion and ſynne, whereby with their great afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they draw vnto
hell, where they ſhall fully ſuffer the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and torments vnder the
Abbat the deuell, which being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and fooliſh men they haue here
begon. For all their life doth vtterly diſagree with the fayth of the
ſonnes, and that which belongeth onely to fayth, to wit to iuſtifie and
ſaue vs, they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their workes. Wherefore theſe men can not both
thus ſticke vnto their ordinances, and therewithall haue faith, which
ſuffereth it ſelfe to be addicted to no certaine workes, but what thinges
ſoeuer the Lord either ſendeth or commaundeth, or the neceſſitie and
neede of our neighbour requireth, it ſuffreth and doth them with great
willingnes &amp; ioy. Theſe he that is endued with faith, counteth his
workes, hauing in the meane ſeaſon no regard of Maſſes, or faſting,
which ſome appoint to certaine dayes, of choiſe of apparell, of meates, of
perſons, of places and ſuch like, yea he greatly diſalloweth of theſe,
inaſmuch as they trouble Chriſtian libertie. Theſe thinges ſhall
ſuffize to haue bin ſpoken concerning the expoſition of this place of
Paul, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter it ſelfe required to ſpend ſo many wordes,
foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the nature of faith is ſo vnknowen. For vnles thou do well
vnderſtand the nature of faith, thou ſhalt perceiue nothing or very litle

ſtate of ſonnes, ſo that the ſpirit muſt be firſt ſent vnto vs,

<hi>Becauſe ye are ſonnes, &amp;c.</hi> To this queſtion we muſt
aunſwere, that Paul ſpeaketh here after the ſame ſort that he ſpake

of the world. All the elect, which are predeſtinate of the Lord that they
ſhall become ſonnes, are counted in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place of ſonnes with God.
Therefore he ſaith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Becauſe ye are ſonnes,</hi> that is,
becauſe the ſtate of ſonnes is appointed vnto you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting,
<hi>God hath ſent forth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Sonne,</hi> to wit, that he might
finiſh it in you, &amp; make you ſuch, as he hath long ſince of his

ſpirit of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sonne of God, that he might continue in commending vnto vs this
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of God, that he hath choſen vs to be ſonnes. For Chriſt is the
Sonne of God, and that moſt beloued. Now if the father giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs his
ſpirit, he will make vs like to his onely begotten ſonne, his true ſonnes
and heires, that we may with certaine confidence crie with Chriſt, <hi>Abba,
Father,</hi> being his brethren, and felow heires with him. Wherin y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
Apoſtle ſurely hath notable ſet forth the goodnes of God, which maketh vs
partakers with Chriſt, and cauſeth vs to haue all thinges common with him,
ſo that we liue, and are ledde by the ſame ſpirit. Moreouer theſe
wordes of the Apoſtle do ſhew, both that the holy Ghoſt is an other from
Chriſt, and yet doth proceede from him, when as he calleth him his ſpirit.
The ſpirit in deede dwelleth in the godly, and no man will ſay that he is
their ſpirit, as here Paul maketh him the holy ſpirit of Chriſt,
ſaying: God hath ſent forth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſpirit of his Sonne, that is of Chriſt.
For he is the ſpirit of God, &amp; cometh from God to vs, and is not ours;
vnles one will ſay after this ſort: my holy ſpirit, as we ſay my God,
my Lord. Wherefore whereas he is here ſaid to be holy ſpirit of Chriſt,
it proueth him to be God, as of whom that ſpirit is ſent, &amp; is
peculiarly counted his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Chriſtians may perceiue by this place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

not only that thy ſynnes be forgiuen thee, but alſo that thou art the
belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſonne of God, which being certaine of eternal ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, dareſt

confident heart. Thou muſt be ſo certaine hereof, that thou canſt not be

to dout any thing herein were no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and contumelie to the death
of Chriſt, as though that had not obtained all thinges for vs, and ought not
farre more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to prouoke and encourage vs to haue a good truſt in
God, then all our ſynnes and tentations are able to put vs out of hope and
fray vs from it. It may be in deede that thou ſhalt be ſo temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that
thou ſhalt feare and doute of thine adoption, and thinke plainly that God is
not a fauourable father, but a wrathfull reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſynners, as it fell out
with Iob and many other ſaincts, but in ſuch a conflict this truſt &amp;
confidence that thou art a ſonne ought to preuaile and ouercome, or els thou
ſhalt come into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and deſperate caſe.</p>
               <p>When one of Cains broode heareth theſe thinges, he is as it
were beſide himſelfe by reaſon of admiration and aſtoniſhment. Fye,
ſayth he, awaye with this arrogancie, and this moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious errour. God
turne this mynde from me, that I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to thinke that I am the
ſonne of God: I am a ſynner, moſt miſerable and wretched, and I will
neuer eſteeme more of my ſelfe. But thou which deſireſt to belong vnto
Chriſt, flie this kynde of men, no otherwiſe then moſt hurtfull enemies
of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, and of thy ſaluation.<note place="margin">Though of our
ſelues we be miſerable ſynners, yet we may aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our

know that we are ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and verie miſerable and wretched: but here we

and what he hath done for our ſake. It is not ſpoken here of our nature,
but of the grace of God, which ſo farre exceedeth our ſynnes, as heauen is
higher then the earth, and the eaſt is diſtant from the weſt, as the 103.
Pſalme ſayth: Now if it ſeeme vnto thee a great honour that thou art the
ſonne of God, as in deede it is verie great, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that it is no

borne of a woman, and made <pb n="312" facs="tcp:9413:165"/> vnder the Lawe, that thou
mighteſt become the ſonne of God. Theſe are great benefites of God, &amp;
do cauſe in the elect a great truſt and confidence in the goodnes of God,
and a ſpirit which is afraide of nothing, but is bold and able to do all
thinges. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the religion of thoſe of Cains broode, as it is a
thing meruelous ſtrait and carefull, ſo doth it make heartes exceeding
fearfull, which ſerue to no vſe, but are vnapt to all thinges, fit neither
to ſuffer or do any thing, which tremble and are afraide euen at the
ſhaking of the leaſe of a tree, as it was before ſpoken of them Leuit.

               <p>Wherefore thou muſt lay vp theſe wordes of the Apoſtle
well in thy minde, thou muſt feele this crie of the ſpirit, which crieth
ſo in the hearts of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful. For how ſhouldeſt thou not heare the
crie of thine owne heart? Neither doth the Apoſtle ſay that he doth
whiſper, ſpeake, yea or ſyng, it is greater then all theſe which the
ſpirit doth in thy heart, he crieth out a maine, that is, with all the heart.
Whereupon it is ſaide Rom. 8, that he maketh requeſt for vs with ſighes
that can not be expreſſed, and that he beareth witnes with our ſpirit
that we are the children of God: how therefore can it be, that our heart
ſhould not heare this crie, ſighes,<note place="margin">Aduerſitie
ſtirreth vp the ſpirit.</note> and teſtimonie of the ſpirit? Howbeit
hereunto tentations and aduerſitie are very profitable, they moue to crie,
and do excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſtirre vp the ſpirit. Notwithſtanding we fooliſh
men do greatly feare and flie the croſſe, wherefore it is no meruell if we
do neuer feele the crie of the ſpirit, and do continually remaine like them
of Cains broode. But if thou doeſt not feele this crie, take heede that thou
be not idle and flothfull, neither ſecure, pray inſtantly, for thou art in
an euell caſe. And yet do not deſire, that thou maiſt feele nothing but
this crie of the ſpirit, thou muſt feele alſo an other terrible crie
made, whereby thou mayſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked and vrged to this crie of the ſpirit,
which happeneth to all the ſaincts: That is the crie of ſynnes, which call
moſt ſtrongly and inſtantly vnto deſperation, but this crie muſt be
ouercome of the ſpirit of Chriſt, by godly calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father, and
crying for his grace, that the truſt and confidence of grace may become
greater then deſperation.<note place="margin">The crie of the ſpirit.</note>
Wherefore this crie of the ſpirit is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to be with all our
heart touched with a very ſtrong, firme, and vnmoueable truſt of moſt
deare ſonnes toward God, as our moſt tender and fauourable Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:9413:165"/>Hereby we may ſee howe farre a

Cain ſayd Gen. 4: <hi>My iniquitie is more then that it may be forgiuen. Thou
haſt caſt me out this day from the vpper face of the earth, and from thy
face shall I be hid, yea it shal come to paſſe that euery one that findeth
me shall ſlay me, &amp;c.</hi> This is a terrible and dreadfull crye, which
is neceſſarily heard of all ſuch as be of Cains brood, foraſmuch as
they truſt to them ſelues and their owne workes, and put not their truſt
in the ſonne of God, neither were and conſider that he was ſent of the
Father, made of a woman, made vnder the lawe, much leſſe that all theſe
thinges were done for their ſaluation. They are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tormented in
their owne works, the miſerable men doe in vaine goe about by them to helpe
them ſelues, and to obtaine the grace of God. And while their vngodlines is
not herewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it beginneth to perſecute euen the ſonnes of God, as
it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wont to doe, yea at the laſt they growe vnto ſuch crueltie,
that after the example of their father Cain they can not reſt, vntil they
ſlay their righteous brother Abell, in whome they doe alſo kill vnto them
ſelues Chriſt. Then the bloode of righteous Abel crieth vnto heauen
againſt vnrighteous Cain, neither ceaſſeth it to cry vntill the Lord hath
reuenged it. He aſketh thoſe Cains of their brother Abel yea of Chriſt:
but they deny all knowledge of Chriſt, which labour not to become the
ſonnes of God and heires by Chriſt, but to become righteous by their owne
workes. In the meane ſeaſon the bloode of Chriſt continually crieth out
againſt them, euen nothing but puniſhment and vengeance, when as for the
elect, it crieth by the ſpirit of Chriſt for nothing but grace &amp;
reconciliation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle vſeth here a Sirian, and a Greeke word,
ſaying: <hi>Abba, Pater.</hi> For this word <hi>Abba</hi> in the Syrian
tongue ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Father, by which name at this day the chiefe of
Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are wont to be called, and by the ſame name Heremites in time
paſt being holy men, did call their Preſidents, at the laſt by vſe it
was alſo made a Latin word. Wherefore that which Paul ſayth is as much as:
Father, Father, or if thou hadſt rather, as, <pb n="314" facs="tcp:9413:166"/> My
father.<note place="margin">Why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the word, Father</note>
But what is the cauſe why the Apoſtle doth double the word, Father, that
is, the crie of the ſpirit? I will by your leaue bringe forth my iudgement
and opinion hereof. Firſt I thinke that he would hereby ſhewe the force and
ſtraining of this holy cry. For when as we cal any with great affection,
&amp; through no ſmall neceſſitie, we are wont eftſoones to double his
name. Nowe becauſe that ſinne, and Cain doe alwayes goe about with
deſperation to ſtoppe this crie of the ſpirit for the grace of the
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is neede ſurely to crie moſt ſtrongly, and with a voice both
doubled, and exceedingly ſtrained forth, that is, the truſt of the grace of
the Father ought to be moſt ſtronge and not able to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. Againe
ſuch is the maner of the Scripture, to witnes the certaintie of a thing,
ſometime to double or iterate the words, as Ioſeph did to Pharao Gen. 41.
So here alſo the ſpirit twiſe calleth vpon the Father, whereby it may
ſhewe the certaintie of his fatherly fauour and grace. For the truſt hereof
ought to be no leſſe certaine, then great and vnmoueable. Finally it is
meete al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to perſeuer, which againe this doubling of the name of father
doth note vnto vs. For as ſoone as we begin to call God Father, Satan with
all his band moueth warre againſt vs, and omitteth no meanes to wreſt from
vs this truſt of ſonnes toward God our Father, wherefore thother Father
muſt be diligently doubled, that is, our truſt and confidence muſt be
confirmed, neither muſt we euer ceaſſe from calling vpon this Father, but
muſt moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly continue in this crie of the ſpirit, whereby we
may obtaine a certen ſure experience of his fatherly goodnes, by which our
truſt in him may be made moſt certaine and ſafe. And perhaps Paul had
reſpect hereunto, when he firſt ſet downe <hi>Abba,</hi> which is a word
ſtraunge to them, to whom he wrote, after adding <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that is
Father, a familiar word and of their owne language, meaning to ſignifie
hereby, that the beginning of ſo great truſt in God is vnaccuſtomed and
euen ſtraunge vnto men, but that when the mind hath a while exerciſed it,
and continued in it although aſſayled with tentations, it becommeth euen
familiar and almoſt naturall, that we now enioy God as a domeſticall
Father, and doe in euery thing moſt confidently call vpon him.</p>

contrary one to an other, that the ſame man can not be both a ſonne and a
ſeruaunt.<note place="margin">A ſonne and a ſeruaunt doe greatly differ. We
can not obtaine ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by workes.</note> A ſonne is free and willing, a
ſeruaunt is compelled and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: a ſonne liueth, and reſteth in
faith: a ſeruaunt in works. And ſo by this place alſo it appeareth, that
we can obtaine no ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God by workes, but before thou workeſt that
which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him, it is neceſſary that thou haue receiued of
him and poſſeſſe ſaluation and all things, that thereupon works may
freely flow forth, to the honour of ſo gratious a father, and to the profit
of thy neighbours, without any feare of puniſhment, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for reward.
This, that which Paule ſayth, proueth: <hi>If thou be a ſonne, thou art
alſo an heire.</hi> For it is ſayd before, that we become the ſonnes of
God by faith, without any workes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heires alſo, as this place
witneſſeth: for by nature they that are ſonnes, the ſame alſo are
heires. But if this inheritance of the Father be nowe thyne by fayth, ſurely
thou art riche in all good things, before thou haſt wrought any thinge. For
howe ſhould it be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by faith thou art the heire of God, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any works
through onely grace, and that thou mayſt againe firſt merit it by works?
Wherefore the caſe ſtandeth, as I often times ſay: To a man that is
baptized and beleueth in Chriſt, the heauenly inheritance of the Father is
already giuen at once, that is, all good thinges, they are only hid as yet by
faith, for that the maner of the preſent life can not ſuffer, that he
ſhoulde enioye them being reuealed. Whereupon Paule ſayth Rom. 8: Ye are
ſaued, but by hope, for ye doe not as yet ſee it, but doe yet waite, when
the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of your good thinges ſhall be reuealed. And 1. Pet.
1. it is ſayd: Your ſaluation is reſerued in heauen and prepared for you,
to be ſhewed in the laſt time.<note place="margin">VVhereunto the workes of a
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to be referred.</note> Wherefore the workes of a
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought not to haue regard of merit, which is the maner of
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, but onely of the vſe and commoditie of his neighbours, that he
doe not liue and worke to him ſelfe, but to his neighbour, whereby he may
truely liue to the glory of God. For by faith he is rich in all good thinges,
and truely bleſſed. Nowe the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>through Chriſt,</hi>
leſt that any thinke that ſo great inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <pb n="316" facs="tcp:9413:167"/>
commeth vnto vs freely,<note place="margin">Although we are ſaued frely &amp;
with out all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in reſpect of our ſelues yet Chriſt hath meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and

coſt. For although it be giuen vnto vs without our coſt, and without all
our merit, yet it coſt Chriſt a deare price, who, that he might purchaſe
it for vs, was made vnder the lawe, and ſatisfied it for vs both by life
&amp; alſo by death. So thoſe benefits which of loue we beſtowe vpon our
neighbour, doe come vnto him freely, and without any char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or labour vnto
him, notwithſtanding they coſt vs ſome thing, inaſmuch as we beſtow
vpon him, although freely and of meere goodnes, yet thoſe thinges that are

               <p>And thus hath Paule called backe his Galathians from the
teachers of workes, which preached nothing but the law, peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the

vs alſo. For the Pope with his Prelats and Monks, hath now too long a time
with intruding and vrging his lawes, which are fooliſh and moſt pernitious,
inaſmuch as they doe euery where diſagree with the word of God, ſeduced
almoſt the whole world from the Goſpell of Chriſt, &amp; plainly
extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the faith of ſonnes, according as the Scripture hath in

euery one that deſireth to obtaine ſaluation, moſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take heede

Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> They, when they entered into the ſhip with Chriſt, and
whileſt there was calmnes in the lake, were nothing diſquieted in mind,
neither felt any feare. Then if one ſhould haue aſked them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they
beleeued, they would haue aunſwered without dout that they did beleeue. For
they did not know that their hart did truſt in that quietnes, for that all
troubles were abſent, and therefore did reſt vpon a thinge viſible, and
not vpon the inuiſible grace of God. Which then was made manifeſt, as
ſoone as the tempeſt was riſen, and the waues did couer the ſhip: for
by and by all their truſt and confidence ceaſſed, for that the quietnes
and calmnes whereunto they truſted was taken away, and diffidence, which
before when al things were proſperous did lurke in their minds, did then
appeare. For this is the nature of diffidence, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth or knoweth no
more then it feeleth. Foraſmuch therefore as it had poſſeſſed the
breſtes of the Apoſtles, they felt nothing now but the fearefull tempeſt,
and the waues couering the ſhip, they ſaw the ſea ſwelling and greatly
raging to threaten nothing <pb n="318" facs="tcp:9413:168"/> but death. Theſe thinges
onely did they thinke vpon, theſe onely did they conſider, and therefore
could there be no meaſure or ende of feare and trembling in their mindes: the
more they weyed in their mind the perill, ſo much more were they terrified,
and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med euen now to ſticke in the very iawes of death, hoping for no
life or deliuerance. And as they could not ſo much as thinke any thing els
becauſe of their vnbeliefe, ſo all comfort alſo was farre from them. For
diffidence or vnbeliefe hath nothing whereunto it may truſt or flee, wherfore
when outward aduerſitie commeth, it admitteth nothing into the mind but it,
and therefore it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer feele any peace or quietnes while this remaineth.
So in hell, where diffidence exerciſeth full tyrannie, there can neuer be any
intermiſſion of deſperation, trembling and terrour.</p>

               <note place="margin">What faith doth in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp;

cunning of faith, that it ſeeth thoſe thinges which are not ſeene or
felt, and ſeeth not thoſe thinges which are felt, yea which are now ſore
vpon vs, and doe preſſe &amp; vrge vs. As on the contrary ſide diffidence
ſeeth nothing but that which it feeleth, neither can it reſt vpon any other
thing but that which it feeleth. For this cauſe thoſe thinges are of God
layd vpon faith, which the whole world is not able to beare, as ſinnes,
death, the world, and the deuil: neither ſuffereth he it to be occupied with
ſmall matters. For who flieth not death? who is not terrified &amp; ouercome

the whole world is not able to bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſubdue the fleſh, but it
rather bringeth vnder and maketh the world ſubiect vnto it, &amp; beareth
rule ouer it, ſo that he liueth carnally whoſoeuer is of the world. But
faith ſubdueth this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duer of all other, holdeth it in ſubiection, and
teacheth it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ruled, but alſo to obey. Likewiſe who is able
to beare the hatred and furie, ignominie and perſecution of the worlde? who
doth not yeelde vnto it and is oppreſſed with it? But faith euen 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:9413:168"/> laugheth at all the iniquitie, rage, and furie thereof,
and maketh that vnto it ſelfe matter of ſpirituall ioy, wherewith other are
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen killed. It doth no otherwiſe behaue it ſelfe againſt Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
Who is able to ouercome him, which practizeth ſo many craftes and wiles,
wherby he ſtayeth and hindereth the truth, the worde of God, faith, and hope,
and ſoweth againſt them innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable errours, ſects, deluſions,
hereſies, deſperations, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and ſuch kind of abominations
without number? All the worlde is to him as a ſparke of fire to a fountaine
of water, it is wholy ſubdued vnto him in theſe euills, as (alas) we both
ſee and trie. But it is faith which troubleth him, for it is not onely not
made ſubiect to his deluſions, but it alſo diſcouereth and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them, that they be no more of any importance, that they are able to doe nothing
but doe vaniſh away, as we haue experience at this day by the decaying and
vaniſhing of the Papacie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. Finally, ſinne hath that force,
that that which is euen the leaſt, can not be appeaſed or extinguiſhed of
any creature, that it doth not gnawe and teare the conſcience, yea if all men
ſhould goe about togither to comfort the conſcience wherein ſinne hath
begun to liue, they ſhould goe about it in vaine. But faith is that noble
Champion, which ouercommeth and extinguiſheth euery ſinne, yea if all the
ſinnes which the whole world hath committed from the beginning were layde

without blood and woundes, that is, we muſt needes feele ſinne, death, the
fleſh, the deuill, and the world, yea and that aſſayling vs ſo
grieuouſly and with ſo great force, that the hart of man doe thinke that he
is paſt all hope, that ſinne hath ouercome, and the deuill gotten the vpper
hande, and on the contrary ſide very litle feele the force of faith. We ſee
an example of this fight here in the Diſciples, for the waues did not onely
ſtrike the ſhip, but did euen couer it, that nothing could be now lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for, but that it ſhould be drowned, eſpecially Chriſt being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, 
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:9413:169"/> and knowing not of this perill: all hope was then
paſt, life ſeemed to be ouercome, and death appeared to haue the victorie.
But as it fel out with the Diſciples in this tentation, ſo alſo doth it
fall out, and muſt fall out with all the godly in all kind of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are of ſinne, the deuill, and the world. In the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne
we muſt needes feele the conſcience thrall vnto ſinnes, the wrath of God
and helliſh paynes to hange ouer vs, and all thinges to be in that caſe, as
though we were paſt all recouerie. Likewiſe when we haue conflict with the
deuill, it muſt appeare, as though truth ſhoulde giue place to errour, and
Satan ſhoulde driue the worde of God out of the whole worlde, and he him
ſelfe reigne for a God with his deluſions &amp; deceits. Neither ſtandeth
the caſe any otherwiſe, when it commeth to paſſe that we are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of
the world, it muſt needes be, that it ſhould greatly rage and cruelly
perſecute vs, ſo that it ſhall ſeeme that no man at all is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to
ſtand, that no man is able to obtayne ſafetie, or profes his faith: that
Cain onely ſhall beare rule, and ſuffer his brother in no place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Albeit we be in daunger &amp; great diſtres,
yet muſt we not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but beleeue that we ſhall be
deliuered</note>But we muſt not iudge according to ſuch feeling and outward
appearance of things, but according to faith. The preſent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to
ſtirre vs vp hereunto, &amp; to be receiued of vs in ſteede of ſpeciall
comfort. For we learne hereof, that albeit ſinnes doe vrge vs, death
diſquiet vs, the world rage againſt vs, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill lay ſnares for
vs, that is, although the waues doe couer the ſhip, yet we muſt not be
diſcouraged. For although thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being wounded doth feele ſinne,
and the wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, yet ſhalt thou not therefore be
plunged in hell. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou therefore die, although euen the whole
world hate and perſecute thee, and gape ſo wide to deuoure thee, as the
mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpreadeth forth it ſelfe: They are onely waues, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vpon thy ſhip doe terrifie thee, and compell thee to crie out, we periſh,
Lord ſaue vs. Thou haſt therefore in the former part of this text, the
nature of faith ſet forth, how it is wont and ought to behaue it ſelfe in
tentation, alſo howe deſperate a thinge diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, and nothing to be
counted of. The other part commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto vs loue in Chriſt, whereby he was
brought ſo farre, that he brake of his ſleepe, aroſe, and counted the
daunger that his Diſciples were in for his owne, and helped them freely,
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or looking for nothing of them therefore. Euen as it is the 
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:9413:169"/> nature of Chriſtian loue to doe all things freely and
of good will to the glorie of God, and profit of our neighbours,<note place="margin">The nature of Chriſtian loue.</note> ſeeking to it ſelfe
nothing thereby. For the exerciſing of which loue man ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted of God, is
left in the earth, euen as Chriſt being made man liued in the earth that he
might do for vs, as he witneſſeth of him ſelfe: <hi>I came not to be

               <head>The Allegories of this deede.</head>
               <p>In this deede Chriſt hath ſet forth the life of
Chriſtians, and the ſtate of ſuch as preach and teache the worde of God.
The ſhip ſignifieth the Church, the ſea the world, the winde the deuill,
the Diſciples of Chriſt are the Preachers and godly Chriſtians: Chriſt
the truth, the Goſpell and faith. Now, before that Chriſt and his
Diſciples enter into the ſhip, the ſea is calme, &amp; the wind quiet,
but when Chriſt with his Diſciples are entred in, by and by ariſeth a
tempeſt. This is that which he ſayd:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi>
10.34 The world can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the ſound and ſincere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the
Goſpell.</note> 
                  <hi>I came not to ſend peace but the ſword.</hi> For if
Chriſt would ſuffer the world to liue after his owne maner, and would not
reproue the workes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it would be quiet enough. But now ſeeing that he
preacheth that they which are counted wiſe men, are fooles: they that are
counted righteous, are ſinners: they that are counted rich, are not
bleſſed, but miſerable, it rageth &amp; is in great furie. So thou
maiſt at this daye finde wiſe men of this worlde, which in deede would
ſuffer the Goſpell to be preached, if the wordes of the Scripture ſhoulde
be ſimply declared, and in the meane ſeaſon the ſtate of
Eccleſiaſticall perſons not reproued: but as ſoone as thou ſhalt
begin to condemne by the Scriptures all thoſe thinges which haue bene
hitherto brought in vnder a falſe name of religion, and to teach that they
are to be reiected as being of no importance, thou preacheſt ſeditiouſly,
and troubleſt the world with vnchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine.</p>
               <p>But how doth the preſent text pertaine vnto vs? A great
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt did ariſe, where that ſhip went, wherein Chriſt and his
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were. Other ſhips did paſſe the ſea quietly, nothing
toſſed of the windes, this ſhip onely muſt be toſſed and couered
with waues, becauſe Chriſt was caried in it. For the world can ſuffer any
kind of preaching beſide the preaching of Chriſt: the cauſe is, for that
he condemneth all thinges of the world,<note place="margin">Why the world can not
abide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.30. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
16.8.</note> and chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <pb n="322" facs="tcp:9413:170"/> all righteouſnes to him
ſelfe, according to that which he ſaith: <hi>He that is not with me, is
againſt me:</hi> and againe: <hi>The Spirit will reproue the worlde of
ſinne, of righteouſnes, and of iudgement.</hi> He ſayth not: will preach,
but, <hi>will reproue,</hi> and not this or that man, but, <hi>the world,</hi>
and whatſoeuer is in the world. Againſt this ſhip of Chriſt all this
tempeſt is rayſed, and it is brought into daunger. For the world doth not
ſuffer his owne thinges to be condemned, but Chriſt can not allowe them,
&amp; if he ſhould allow them, he had come in vaine. For if the world were
wiſe by it ſelfe, and did knowe and followe the truth, what neede had there
bene that Chriſt &amp; his Diſciples ſhould preach? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a
ſmall comfort to Chriſtians,<note place="margin">A comfort to true Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
that they knowe before that they ſhal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
eſpecially to Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that they are certaine before, that as ſoone as
they ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to preach Chriſt to the world, they muſt ſuffer
perſecution, &amp; that it can not be otherwiſe. So that it is a ſure
ſigne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be wiſhed, that it is true Chriſtian preaching,
if it be tried with perſecution, eſpecially of the holy, learned and wiſe
men of the worlde. As it is an vndouted ſigne alſo, that it is
vnchriſtian preaching, if it be prayſed commonly and honoured of the world,
according to that ſaying Luke 6: <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men hate you,
and put out your name as euill, for the Sonne of mans ſake: for ſo did
their fathers to the Prophets.</hi> Now marke how our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men do
behaue them ſelues, and of what ſort their doctrine is: They haue got into
their ſubiection the riches, glorie, and power of the world, and they that
prayſe them, enioy the honour and pleaſures thereof, their caſe in all
thinges agreeth with the caſe of the falſe Prophets, and yet they dare
boaſt them ſelues to be Preachers and Teachers of Chriſt, and
worſhippers of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of whom the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Gods word muſt
looke for &amp; deſire helpe in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</note>The next thinge, whereby this deede doth comfort and
encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Preachers of Chriſt, is, that it ſheweth where helpe is to
be aſked, when a tempeſt is riſen: to wit, not of the world, for not mans
wiſedom or power, but Chriſt him ſelfe, and he alone is able to helpe
them. Him they muſt call vpon in euery diſtres with full confidence, in him
they muſt truſt, as his Diſciples here did. For vnles they had beleeued
that Chriſt was able to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the daunger wherein they were, they would
not haue awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, and prayed him to ſaue them: although their faith then
was very weake, and very much diffidence was in them, for that 
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:9413:170"/> they did not confidently commit them ſelues with him
vnto daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, douting nothing but he was able to deliuer them out of the
middeſt of the ſea, and from death it ſelfe. Hereof therefore let it be
acknowledged as certaine, that as no Iudge or Moderator can be giuen to the
word of God, but God onely, ſo there can be had no other maintainer or
defender thereof: who as he ſendeth it out whether he will without any merit
or counſell of men, ſo he alone alſo will defende &amp; preſerue it
without the ayde or ſtrength of men: and therefore he that ſeeketh ayde
vnto this word of men, ſhall without dout fall, being forſaken as well of
men as of God.</p>
               <p>Whereas Chriſt did ſleepe, it giueth vs to vnderſtand,
that in the time of perſecution he doth ſometimes withdraw him
ſelfe,<note place="margin">Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
and trouble with draweth him ſelf &amp; differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his help for a
while.</note> &amp; ſeemeth as though he ſlept, whiles that he giueth not
ſtrength &amp; power valiantly to reſiſt, the peace and tranquillitie of
minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now diſturbed, but ſuffereth vs to wraſtle and labour with
our infirmitie for a while, that we may acknowledge how we are altogither
nothing, and that all thinges doe depend on his grace and power. As Paule
confeſſeth of him ſelfe 2. Cor. 1. that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed that he ſhoulde be
ſo preſſed and troubled out of meaſure, that we ſhould not truſt in
our ſelues but in God, which rayſeth the dead. Such ſleepe of God Dauid
oftentimes felt, and maketh mention thereof in many places: <hi>Ariſe, awake,
O Lorde: why ſleepeſt thou? why dooſt thou forget vs? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſumme, the preſent text offereth vnto vs two principall
thinges full of confidence and godly boldnes. The firſt, that when
perſecution is riſen for the word of God, we may ſay: We knew that it
would ſo come to paſſe. Chriſt is in the ſhip, therefore the ſea
ſo rageth, the windes trouble vs, the waues fall vpon vs as though they would
drowne vs. But let them rage and be furious as much as they may: it is
certaine, the ſea and the windes doe obey Chriſt which is the other
principall thinge which this text offereth. Perſecution ſhall extend no
farther, nor rage any lenger then he will, and albeit the waues doe euen
ouerwhelme vs, yet muſt they be obedient at his becke. He is Lorde ouer all,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing ſhall hurt vs: he onely endue vs with his grace, that we
be not ouercome by vnbeliefe and ſo deſpeire, Amen.</p>
               <p>Whereas the men merueiled and prayſed the Lorde, as vnto whom
the ſea and windes doe obey,<note place="margin">The Goſpel is more ſpread
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and faith increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</note> it ſignifieth that
the Goſpell and word of God is ſo farre from being extinguiſhed by
perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="324" facs="tcp:9413:171"/> that thereby it is ſpread farther
abroad, and faith alſo is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and becommeth ſtronger. Wherein it
appeareth howe diuers the nature of this diuine good thinge is from the good
thinges of the world, which decay by calamitie and misfortune, and are
increaſed by proſperitie and fortunate affayres: But the kingdom of
Chriſt is increaſed and ſtrengthened by tribulation and aduerſitie: but
is diminiſhed and weakned by peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie. Whereupon Paule
ſayth 2. Cor. 12: <hi>The Lordes power is made perfect through weakenes:</hi>
which God performe in vs alſo, Amen.</p>

vſe moſt rare. For in ſuch merueilous order and colours he painteth out
Chriſtian life, as it can not be pleaſaunt to the fleſh to behold.
Firſt he ſayth:<note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

               <hi>As workers togither we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you.</hi> He
calleth the Miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word togither workers, as 1. Cor. 3. he alſo
ſayth: <hi>VVe togither are Gods labourers, ye are Gods husbandrie, and Gods
building.</hi> Which is thus much in effect: We preach and labour in the worde
among you by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching &amp; exhorting, but God inwardly with his ſpirit doth
bleſſe and giue the encreaſe, leſt that the outward labour in the word
be in vaine. And ſo God is the inward and true Maiſter, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to
paſſe all thinges, whom we ſerue in the office of outward preaching. Now
he calleth him ſelfe &amp; his fellowes ſuch togither workers, leſt they
ſhould contemne the outward word, as though they either had not neede of it,
or had already ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly attayned to the knowledge therof. For although

giue to Preachers this office, name, &amp; dignitie, that they be counted

that learning or holines vnto him ſelf, that he neglect euen neuer ſo

perpetual, continuing &amp; permanent doctrine, but rather that it is like
raine that ſodainly commeth &amp; ſoone paſſeth away when as the Sunne
and heat come by and by and take away al the moiſture that is left thereof,
and afterward ſcorch and hurt thinges neuertheles. This very experience
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, for no man ſhall be able to bringe forth euen one place in the
world, where the Goſpell hath remained pure and ſincere aboue the age of

departed, and by and by after followed heretikes and falſe teachers, with
their deluſions and falſe doctrine peruerting and corrupting all thinges.
So Moſes foretold his Iſraelites, that by and by after his death it
ſhould come to paſſe, that they ſhould depart from the way of the
Lorde, and corrupt their owne wayes, which the booke of Iudges witneſſeth
to haue come to paſſe. Moreouer the ſame booke ſayth, that as often as
any iudge which had called againe the word of the Lord did die, they fell
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine forthwith to their vngodlines, &amp; made all things worſe and
worſe. So Ioas the king continued in his dutie ſo long as Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iada the

ſelfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 20 29.</note> &amp; left the office of
a good and godly King. Neither fell it out otherwiſe after Chriſt had

            <p>Moreouer, to receiue grace in vaine can be nothing els,<note place="margin">What

are repleniſhed with grace and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea it is vnſpeakeable howe
great felicitie theſe wordes doe ſpeake of. Whereas he firſt ſayth:
<hi>a tyme accepted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</note> it is
ſpoken by an Hebrewe figure, and is as much as if thou ſay: a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
tyme and repleniſhed with the fauour of God, wherein God turneth away his
anger, and declareth nothing but loue toward vs, and a ready will to helpe vs.
Our ſinnes are blotted out, not onely thoſe that be paſt, but thoſe
alſo which as yet ſticke in our fleſh, and that I may ſpeake in a word:
the kingdom of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is preſent, wherein nothing but forgiuenes of
ſinnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of grace is ſhewed: heauen ſtandeth open, the
right yeare of Iubile is come, wherein all dettes are remitted, and no grace is
denied. Whereupon he ſayth: <hi>In a time accepted haue I heard thee,</hi>
that is, now I fauour thee &amp; am mercifull vnto thee, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:9413:173"/> thou wilt haue, pray for it, and thou ſhalt obtayne
it, and certainly receiue it. Onely let not the fault be in thy ſelfe, pray,
while this time endureth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The day of ſaluation.</note>
               <hi>Beholde nowe
the day of ſaluation.</hi> He calleth this the time and day of ſaluation,
that is of helpe and felicitie. For we are not onely certayne hereof, that God
is mercifull and fauourable vnto vs, and we acceptable vnto him, but alſo as
we beleeue, and by faith are ſure of his goodnes toward vs, ſo he declareth
in deede, heareth them that crie vnto him, helpeth and ſaueth them, yea and
maketh them plainly bleſſed. We therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely acknowledge and
confeſſe this tyme to be the wiſhed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, happie, and very day
of ſaluation. For it behoueth that both be togither, both that God fauour vs,
and alſo that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his fauour towards vs by worke or deede. That he
fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, the accepted tyme which is nowe preſent doth witnes: that he
doth alſo helpe vs and finiſh our ſaluation, this other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth,
to wit the day of ſaluation, the day of helpe. But as the ſtate of the life
of Chriſtians is, if thou wilt iudge according to the outward man, thou wilt
iudge it rather a tyme of affliction, wrath and indignation, wherein the
Goſpell is preached, and wherein they liue, then a time of grace and
ſaluation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wordes of the ſpirit muſt be ſpiritually
vnderſtood, ſo ſhall we eaſily ſee &amp; perceiue that theſe noble
and moſt pleaſaunt names doe moſt rightly and properly belong to the tyme
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Goſpell flouriſheth, that it is a tyme accepted, that is, full
of grace, and a time of ſaluation, whereby ſurely all the riches and
felicitie of Chriſtes kingdom are notably commended and ſet forth vnto
vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let vs giue no occaſion of offence in any thinge.</hi>
Foraſmuch therefore as there is ſo acceptable and gratious a tyme, let vs,
ſayth he, vſe it worthely, and not receiue it in vayne. Firſt
ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to giue no occaſion of offence to any man, leaſt that our
office of preachinge Chriſt be reprehended,<note place="margin">No offence
muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen whereby the Goſpell may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Double oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence may be giuen, whereby the Goſpel is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</note> whereby
he ſufficiently declareth what offence he meaneth, namely, that the doctrine
of the Goſpell may not be ſtumbled at, as though he taught that which is
not perfect and ſound. Nowe there may be giuen a double occaſion of
offence, whereby the Goſpell is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: one, wherby the Heathen are
offended, when as ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel ſeeke the libertie
of the fleſh, wil not be <pb n="329" facs="tcp:9413:173"/> obedient to magiſtrates,
turning the libertie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, into fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiouſnes. Theſe
do meruelouſly offend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcreeter &amp; wiſer ſort of the Heathen,
and make that they hate the Goſpell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe, which they thinke
doth teach this licentiouſnes: and ſo as it were with a certaine force they
do by this their inſolencie repell and driue them from the faith of Chriſt:
for they meaſuring all Chriſtians by theſe, do deteſt them as light
men, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the common wealth, and therefore not to be ſuffered.
This offence therefore, and this reprehenſion, or rather hatred and
perſecution of the Goſpel we acknowledge to come through theſe
prepoſterous Chriſtians. An other offence is, whereby eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſtians
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues are ſometime offended, through the vnſeaſonable vſe
of Chriſtian libertie, in meates and other indifferent thinges, whereat the
weaker ſort in faith do ſometime ſtumble. Whereof the Apoſtle hath
giuen many preceptes 1. Cor. 8. Rom. 14. He exhorteth therefore here vnto that,
whereof he admoniſheth in other wordes 1. Cor. 10: <hi>So behaue your
ſelues, that ye giue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor to the Grecians,
nor to the Church of God: euen as I pleaſe all men in all things, not
ſeeking mine owne profit, but the profit of many, that they might be
ſaued.</hi> The ſame he teacheth alſo Philip. 2. that euerie man looke
not on his owne things, but on the things of other men, for ſo all offence
ſhould be eaſily taken away, nay none at all ſhould be giuen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That our miniſterie be not reprehended.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Though we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not bring to paſſe that the word of God be not
at all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, yet muſt we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour that it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
through our fault.</note> Who can bring to paſſe that our miniſterie
ſhall not be reprehended, ſeeing that the Goſpell is neceſſarily
ſubiect to perſecution, no leſſe then Chriſt himſelfe? In deede it
is not in vs to make that the worde of God be not reprehended and perſecuted
of them which are ignoraunt of God, and do not beleeue: for it is a rocke of
offence, Eſai. 8. Rom. 9. this offence commeth becauſe of our faith, and
can not be auoided of vs, and therefore the blame thereof ought not to be layde
vpon vs. Howbeit there is an other offence which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hereof, for that
our loue is not ſufficient dutifull, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth through vs, inaſmuch as
our workes are the cauſe thereof, becauſe they do not ſo ſhine by
faith, that they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h are
conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt with vs may thereby be prouoked to ſerue God, as it is meete.
This offence is giuen through our fault, whom it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo to liue, that
the Iewes, Heathen &amp; Princes of the world <pb n="330" facs="tcp:9413:174"/> might haue
no occaſion to ſay: Beholde how light and naughtie theſe men are, yea and
verie wicked wretches, the doctrine of life which they follow muſt needes be
euell and peſtilent. So our infamie and crimes are occaſion of offence to
others, and of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and deteſtation of the moſt holy word of God. For
whereas we ought ſo to know, preach and folow it, that thereby both our
neighbours might be brought vnto God, and to the leading of a godly life, and
alſo the glorie of God ſet forth, we by our naughty and ſlouthfull life
bring to paſſe that it doth not onely bring no profit and commodity to our
neighbours, but is brought into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and made deteſtable through our
meanes, bearing our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie and reproche. Now it is a moſt horrible
ſynne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by our naughtines to make the word of God which is
moſt holy and bringeth ſaluation, to make it I ſay, ſo odious, and to
repell and driue men from it, to our owne, and their moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in all thinges let vs behaue our ſelues as the
miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, &amp;c.</hi> Here he
deſcribeth in order the ſignes &amp; proper tokens of a Chriſtian life,
wherewith it ought to be adorned in outward conuerſation: Not meaning that
one is made a Chriſtian and godly hereby, but as he ſayth, that by theſe
as by proper frutes and ſignes of Chriſtianitie, we ſhould ſhew our
ſelues to be both, and behaue our ſelues as the miniſters of God, that is
as Chriſtians &amp; godly men. And marke well that he ſayth: <hi>as the
miniſters of God.</hi> It may ſeeme very ſtraunge, that the miniſterie
of God conſiſteth in theſe, in many afflictions, in neceſſities, in
diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in priſons, in tumults, in watchings, in
faſtings, &amp;c. Among theſe he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth not Maſſes, and prayers for
the dead, or other trifles of fained worſhip of God. He rehearſeth thoſe
things that pertaine to the true and right ſeruice of God, whereby the body
is chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the fleſh tamed. Which is well to be noted, leſt
that any neglect faſtings, watchings and labour, and make us count of them
for that they do not iuſtifie. They bring not righteouſnes in deede, yet
are they frutes of righteouſnes being obtained, wherein thou mayſt be
exerciſed, and whereby thou mayſt keepe thy fleſh in ſubiection, and
enforce it to do his dutie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In tumults.</hi> He rehearſeth tumults or ſeditions among
the reſt, not that it becommeth vs to teach or moue them, who ought 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:9413:174"/> to obey Magiſtrates, and with quietnes to liue
obedient vnto all in that which is good, as Paule teacheth Rom. 13, and
Chriſt Matth. 22: <hi>Giue vnto Ceſar thoſe thinges that are
Ceſars:</hi> but that we muſt beare tumultes of others, as alſo
neceſſities, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, ſtripes, and impriſonments, which we
muſt cauſe or procure vnto none, but ſuffer being procured and layde vpon
vs by others. Wherefore in the firſt place he ſetteth much patience, which
ſurely moueth no ſedition or tumult, but rather ſuffreth it, and
appeaſeth it, if it can. But in the meane ſeaſon it ſingularly
comforteth vs at this time,<note place="margin">Chriſtians commonly accuſed
to raiſe ſedition and tumults, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſame being
raiſed of other.</note> when as tumults are commonly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto vs, for
that this is incident to a Chriſtian life, that for the preaching of the
Goſpell it is accuſed to raiſe ſedition, which it rather ſuffereth
being raiſed of other againſt the word of God. For as in time paſt Achab
accuſed the moſt holy Prophet Elias of ſedition, affirming that it was he
that troubled Iſraell, when as he himſelfe in deede did trouble it: ſo is
it neither a ſhamefull nor new thinge, for vs to be accuſed of the ſame
when we preach the ſame word. Let vs thinke when the enemies of God lay this
reproche and ſclaunder vpon vs, that not onely Elias, not onely the
Apoſtles, but Chriſt himſelfe was counted of the Iewes a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
felow, &amp; crucified, a title being writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in three languages and put on the
croſſe, that he ſhould of all be counted as a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious king of the
Iewes, which would haue moued that people againſt Ceſar, and adioined them
to himſelfe, who in deede by word and example of his life taught nothing more
themſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and obedience, and liued ſo that he was ready to profit
and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto all. As for the reſt whereof the Apoſtle here maketh
mention, as patience, affliction, neceſſitie, diſtres, ſtripes,
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, labour, watchinges, faſting, puritie: it is eaſie to
vnderſtand how they pertaine to the miniſterie of God, who truely
diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to haue ſlouthfull, idle, gluttonous, and drowſie
miniſters, and ſuch as can not abide aduerſitie and trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he
ſpecially reproueth our delicate ones, which quietly enioy reuenues and
rents, and take their delight and pleaſure, thinking that it is an vnworthie
thinge that they ſhould labour, for they are ſhauen, weare long gownes, and
crie out in temples &amp;c. Howbeit theſe ſhall not be able to approue
themſelues before God,<note place="margin">God will haue none to be idle, but
alſo labour and ſo eate their owne bread.</note> who will haue all to
labour, and eate their owne and not other mens bread, as it is written by Paule
to the Theſſalonians. Who therefore <pb n="332" facs="tcp:9413:175"/> teacheth here
alſo, that God is ſerued by labour, and not that onely, but that we alſo
are thereby proued and commended to be the miniſters of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In knowledge.</hi> Paule taketh knowledge here for that which
we call prudence or wiſedom, wherby we vſe things with reaſon, behauing
our ſelues with diſcretion and comelines. Of which knowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying
alſo of Paul Rom. 10. is vnderſtood: <hi>They haue the zeale of God, but
not according to knowledge,</hi> that is, they beare a zeale to the lawe not
prudently, not weying and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering all things well, that they might do no
vndecent thing. Wherefore whereas he here expreſſely requireth knowledge in
the miniſterie of God,<note place="margin">Chriſtians muſt frame their life
pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and with ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſcretion.</note> he thereby admoniſheth
vs, that we frame our life with reaſon, and order it prudently, in all things
keeping a meane, and hauing an aduiſed rehard of our neighbours, leſt that
in any thing we offende y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weaker ſort, with vnſeaſonable vſe of
Chriſtian libertie, and that we do all thinges to the edifying of all. So we
muſt labour, faſt, watch, and applie our ſelues to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie and
ſuch other thinges, not aboue meaſure, that either the body may be in
daunger by too much honger and watching, or the true puritie of life by
ouermuch abſtinence from matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall companie, but we muſt vſe theſe
thinges with knowledge, that is with conuenient wiſedome and diſcretion,
that they may not any whit hurt, but alwayes edifie. Whereupon Paule 1. Cor. 7.
expreſſely admoniſheth maried folkes, that they abſtaine not ouermuch
from mutuall companie, leſt that they be tempted of Satan. In all theſe
therefore, in faſtings, watchings, labours, chaſtitie &amp;c: the Apoſtle
would preſcribe and appoint no rule, lawe or meaſure, which the councels of
the Pope and Monkes do, but the meane or meaſure to be obſerued in them he
left free to euerie mans knowledge and diſcretion, that euerie one may
conſider with himſelfe how much or long he muſt labour, faſt, watch, or
abſtaine, to this ende that the fleſh may be camed and made obedient to the
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In long ſuffering, in kindnes, in the holy Spirit.</hi> What
the two former are the Apoſtle hath at large ſufficiently declared Rom. 2.
Gal. 5. But whereas he ſaith: <hi>In the holy Spirit,</hi> it may be
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood after two ſorts, either that he ſpeaketh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt,
God himſelfe, or that he meaneth by the holy ſpirit the true force and
maner of a ſpirituall life, as though he would admoniſh in 
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:9413:175"/> this maner: Beware of an hypocriticall ſpirit, which
wilbe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a holy ſpirit through a meruelous ſhew and craftie
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaiting of ſpirituall thinges, when it is in deede an vncleane,
prophane, and an euell ſpirit, and bringeth in nothing but ſects and
hereſies.<note place="margin">A true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life.</note> But liue ye in
the true &amp; holy ſpirit which is giuen of God, which giueth and
maintaineth vnitie, one mynde, heart and affection, whereof he ſpeaketh
alſo Eph. 4: <hi>Endeuour to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of
peace.</hi> They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which perſeuer in the ſame true faith, mynde
and ſentence, behaue themſelues as the miniſters of God in the holy
ſpirit, being truly ſpirituall, and liuing a ſpirituall life. For a
ſyncere ſpirituall life, which is led by the aſſiſtaunce of the holy
ſpirit of God, is alſo led in the vnitie of myndes, the hearts by faith
being affected after the ſame ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In loue vnfained, in the word of truth.</hi> As he ſet the
holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt heretikes and falſe Prophets, ſo he ſetteth
vnfained loue againſt ſlouthfull and ſluggiſh Chriſtians, who albeit
they haue the ſame meaning and mynde in the true ſpirituall life, as
concerning opinions of doctrine, yet are they remiſſe, colde and faint in
loue. So he ſetteth the word of truth againſt them which abuſe the word
of God, and interpret it according to their owne affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that thereby they
may get them a name and profit. For as falſe ſpirits do contemne the word
of the Scripture, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre themſelues before it: ſo theſe do in
deede boaſt of the word, and wilbe counted maiſters of the Scripture, but
by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations do peruert the ſenſe and meaning thereof.
Againſt theſe Peter ſpeaketh: <hi>If any man ſpeake, let him ſpeake
as the wordes of God,</hi> that is, let him take heede that he be certaine that
thoſe wordes which he ſpeaketh, be the wordes of God, and not his owne
vaine imagination. Now Paule calleth that here the word of truth, which y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is
ſyncere word of God,<note place="margin">The word of truth.</note> not which is
vnſyncere &amp; fained, which foraſmuch as it is ours, is falſly called
the word of God. For that which we call the true &amp; right word, the Hebrewes
call the word of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the power of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In ſpirituall
functions &amp; matters of ſaluation we muſt do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which we
are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that God worketh by vs.</note> Of this power Peter alſo
ſpeaketh 1. Pet. 1. <hi>If any man miniſter, let him do it as of the
abilitie which God miniſtreth.</hi> And Paule Coloſſ. 1: <hi>Whereunto I
alſo labour and ſtriue, according to his working, which worketh in me
mightely.</hi> Againe Rom. 15: <hi>I dare not ſpeake of anything which 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:9413:176"/> Chriſt hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles
obedient. &amp;c.</hi> Chriſtians muſt be certaine that they are the
kingdome of God, and do nothing at all, eſpecially in ſpirituall functions,
and thoſe thinges that pertaine to the ſaluation of ſoules, whereof they
are not certaine, that it is not they which worke, but God that worketh by
them. For in the kingdome of God it is meete, that God alone do ſpeake,
commaund, do, diſpoſe, and worke all thinges. This Chriſt ment wen he

author of them, which doth them and not you.</p>

               <hi>By the armour of righteouſnes on the right hand, and on the
left, by honour and dishonour, &amp;c.</hi> This armour he deſcribeth more at
large in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians &amp; Theſſalonians. He
rehearſeth there the girdle of veritie,<note place="margin">The ſpiritual
armour of a Chriſtian.</note> the breſt plate of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, the
ſhoes of preparation to preach the Goſpell, the ſhield of faith, the
helmet of ſaluation, &amp;c. This armour of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, he calleth in
his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, the armour of God, both are to this ende,
that he may turne Chriſtians from corporall and prophane armour, and
admoniſh them, that they are a ſpirituall people, and therefore muſt be
furniſhed with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall armour, wherewith they muſt alwayes fight a
ſpirituall fight with ſpirituall enemies, which here he rehearſeth, and
ſheweth that they do aſſaile vs both on the right hand and on the
left.<note place="margin">The enemies of Chriſtians which aſſaile them on

and that we are counted as deceiuers, vnknowen, dying, chaſtened,
ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, poore, hauing nothing. For all theſe thinges come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſtians, they are openly defamed, being reproched to their face, and by
infamie falſly accuſed and railed on, counted as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers and followers
of moſt wicked trades. They are as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne although noble, all refuſing
to be friends with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the perilous confeſſion of the name
of Chriſt, yea it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times commeth to paſſe that they that were their
moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friends are aſhamed of them, for that they haue ſo euell a
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and are verie ill ſpoken of among the chiefe, richeſt, wiſeſt,
and mightieſt of the world. They are dying, that is, as ſheepe appointed to
the ſlaughter, they looke for death euery moment, by reaſon of the great
hatred and enuie which the euell beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, being alwayes perſecuted
of the chiefe of the world. <pb n="335" facs="tcp:9413:176"/> They are chaſtened, for it
often times falleth out that they are ſtriken and beaten, and do by other
diſcommodities trie how they are enuied of the world, and how great
indignation the mightie of the world beare againſt them. They are as
ſorrowing, for all outward thinges are againſt them, and the whole world
giueth many cauſes of griefes vnto them. They are as poore, for there is no
man of the world which will giue them any thing, euerie man is ready to hurt
and endamage them. Neither do they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe any thinge, for although
all thinges be not taken from them at once, yet are they in that ſtate that
they daily looke for it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe aduerſities &amp; as enemies

Finally it commeth to paſſe by the conſolation of the ſpirit, that they
do then moſt of all reioyce, when they are in greateſt affliction. For
their heart reioyceth in God, which ioy burſteth forth, and vttereth it
ſelfe in wordes, workes, and geſtures. And albeit they be poore in
corporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, yet are they neuer famiſhed with hunger, but with
the word of God do enrich verie many in ſpirit, &amp; ſtand not in neede of
any thing, although they haue nothing, for all thinges are in their handes, for
that all creatures muſt ſerue the beleeuers, as Chriſt ſayth: <hi>To
him that beleeueth all thinges are poſſible.</hi> 
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:9413:177"/>
Theſe things albeit they be the excellent giftes of God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
if the feare of God ſhould be abſent, euen they ſhould be turned into
enemies vnto vs, and therefore is it needefull that we be ſtrongly fenſed
againſt them with the armour of God, leſt that they make vs waxe proud, or
inſolently puffe vs vp. A Chriſtian man therefore is meruelouſly free,
and addicted to nothing but to God alone, he ſetteth God onely before his
eyes, he endeuoureth to come ſtraight vnto him by the midle and hie waye,
betweene thoſe thinges which aſſaile on the right hand and on the left,
ſo that he is neither throwen downe by aduerſitie, nor puffed vp by
proſperity, but vſeth both moſt rightly, both to the glorie of God and
profit of his neighbours. We muſt, ſayth the Apoſtle, liue ſuch a life,
while it is the time of grace and of the liuely light of the Goſpell, leſt
that while this daye ſhineth we worke not, and that ſhall haue ſhined
vnto vs in vaine. This is the true miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God which onely he
alloweth, wherein he graunt that we may ſerue him, and that moſt dutifully,
Amen.</p>

they might thereby be prouoked to keepe that faſt ſo much more
religiouſly, which ſurely was nothing but a vaine trifle. Firſt, for that
no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of Chriſt, who liued without any meat,
fortie dayes, and ſo many nights. Chriſt rather followed the example of
Moſes herein, then gaue vnto vs any example to follow, Moſes receiuing the
Lawe, was fortie dayes &amp; fortie nights in the mount Sinai without meat:
ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time would Chriſt alſo faſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to bring &amp; publiſh a
new law. Againe, this faſting is a peruerſe thing, inaſmuch as it was 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:9413:178"/> ordained of men. For albeit Chriſt faſted fortie
dayes, yet haue we no word of his whereby he hath commaunded vs alſo to do
the ſame. He did many other thinges beſide notwithſtanding he will not
haue vs alſo to do them: thoſe thinges that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to do,
thoſe thinges, I ſay, we muſt endeuour to do, that thereby we may obey
his wil.<note place="margin">A moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked abuſe of faſting.</note> But
the moſt peſtilent thing of all herein was, that we tooke vpon vs, and
vſed faſting as a good and meritorious worke, not to tame the fleſh
thereby, but to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for ſynnes, and to procure the fauour of God
vnto our ſelues. Which wicked opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made our faſting ſo foule, filthie
and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable before God, that no feaſtings, bankets, gluttonie and
dronkennes are ſo filthie and deteſtable before him, &amp; it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

one might haue taken it vpon him of his owne accord, but was enforced by the

and with a grudging mynde, it could not be but vaine and vnacceptable to God. I
ſpeake not what other hurt it did in women with child, in yong children, in
the weake and aged. Wherefore we will more rightly conſider this text, and

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two ſorts of faſting, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

faſting which are laudable: one, which is taken vpon vs of our owne accord,
to tame the fleſh, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 2. Cor. 6. where he
exhorteth vs to behaue our ſelues as the miniſters of God, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
watchings, &amp; faſtings among the reſt. An other, which in deede is not
taken vpon vs willingly, yet is willingly borne of vs, when by reaſon of
neede and pouertie we haue not whereon to feede. Whereof Paule ſpeaketh
alſo in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, the fourth chapter:
<hi>Vnto this houre we both hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt.</hi> And Chriſt Matth. 9:
<hi>VVhen the bridegrome shalbe taken from them, then shall they faſt.</hi>
This faſting Chriſt teacheth vs by his preſent example, who being alone
in the deſert and hauing no meat, did ſuffer that neede and hunger
patiently. The firſt of theſe two faſtes may when we pleaſe be left and
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with eating of meat: but this laſt muſt be ſuffred vntill the
Lord ende and breake it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:9413:178"/>Now the cauſe why the Euangeliſt did
ſo diligently firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that Ieſus was led aſide of the ſpirit
into the wildernes, that he ſhould there faſt and be tempted, is this:
leſt that any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him to faſt of his owne mynde and for his owne
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſake, ſhould in vaine endeuour to follow this example of
Chriſt. For he muſt looke for the leading aſyde of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, he
will cauſe faſting and tentation enough:<note place="margin">We muſt not
procure ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to our ſelues, but patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, when it
pleaſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord to ſend it.</note> for he that without the leading
aſyde of the ſpirit, ſhould voluntarily bring himſelfe into daunger of
hunger, or any other tentation, when by the bleſſing of God he hath what to
eate and drinke, and whereby to liue quietly, he, I ſaye, ſhould plainly
tempt the Lord. We muſt not procure to our ſelues pouertie and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they will come ſoone enough of themſelues, onely when they are ſent of
the Lord we muſt endeuour to beare them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently. <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as the
Euangeliſt writeth, <hi>was led aſide of the ſpirite into the
wildernes,</hi> he did not chooſe to himſelfe the wildernes. They are led
with the Spirite of God, which are the ſonnes of God, Romans 8. The good
thinges which the Lorde giueth, he giueth for this, that we maye enioye them
with thankes giuing, not that we ſhould neglect them, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, this hiſtory is written vnto vs both to
inſtruct,<note place="margin">The hiſtorie of Chriſtes tentation
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth both inſtruction &amp; exhortation.</note> and alſo to exhort.
To inſtruct, that we may learne hereby, that Chriſt by this his faſting,
hunger, tentation and victorie againſt Satan did ſerue vs, &amp; furthered
our ſaluation: that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, may neuer neede, or be hurt
by any tentation, but rather ſhall abound with good thinges in the middes of
pouertie, and be ſafe in the middes of tentation, for that his head and Lord
Chriſt hath ouercome all theſe thinges for him, whereof by fayth he is
moſt certain, according as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord himſelfe ſayth Ioh. 16: <hi>Be ye of
good comfort, I haue ouercome the world.</hi> And if God could without meat
nouriſh his Chriſt fortie dayes &amp; ſo many nights, ſo he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> alſo Chriſtians. We are
exhorted alſo here, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this example of Chriſt, we ſuffer
hunger, tentation, and other neceſſities whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come, and when the
caſe ſo requireth, to the glorie of God &amp; profit of our neighbours. And
ſurely if we do earneſtly confeſſe and ſticke to the word of God,
theſe thinges will vndoutedly come vnto vs. The preſent text therefore
contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a meruelous conſolation and ſtrengthening of faith, againſt 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:9413:179"/> the filthie and incredulous bellie, which being
dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully weyed, our conſcience ſhalbe verie much
comforted and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthened, that we may not be carefull for liuing, but
truſt with a full confidence, that God will giue vs plentifully thoſe
thinges that be neceſſarie. Now, that this tentation alſo is incident
vnto vs it is manifeſt. For as Chriſt was led aſide into the wildernes,
that is, was left alone of God, Angels, men, and all creatures, which might
helpe him:<note place="margin">How we are ſometime led aſide into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wildernes.</note> ſo alſo falleth it out with vs. We are led aſide into
the wildernes, we are forſaken and left alone. And this in deede is it, which
eſpecially grieueth vs, to feele or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing whereunto we may
truſt, or from whence we may looke for helpe. As when it lyeth vpon me to
prepare ſuſtenance for me and mine, and I haue nothing at all of my
ſelfe, neither perceiue any helpe comming from any man, neither know where to
looke for any. This is to be led aſide into the deſert, and to be left
alone, I being in this caſe, am in the true exerciſe of faith, then I
learne how I my ſelfe am nothing, howe weake my faith is, how great and rare
a thing ſounde faith is, and howe deepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable incredulitie is ſetled
in the harts of all. But he that hath as yet a purſe heauie with money, a
ſeller ful of wine, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar repleniſhed with graine, he is not yet led
aſide into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, or left alone, and therefore can not feele
tentation while theſe thinges remaine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Satan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Chriſt with care for the
belly and diffidence of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note>Secondly, Satan commeth, and
tempteth Chriſt with this care for the bellie, and diffidence of the goodnes
of God, ſaying: <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, commaund that theſe
ſtones be made bread.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dutch
prouerbe: Truſt in God, and in the meane ſeaſon neglect to bake bread.
Tarie till a roſted chicken flie into thy mouth. Go now, and ſay that thou
haſt a God, who is carefull for thee. Where is now that thy heauenly Father,
who hath ſo great a care of thee? Hath he not goodlily forſaken thee? Eate
now and drinke of thy faith, and let vs ſee how thou ſhalbe ſuffiſed:
it were well wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> thee, if
thou couldeſt feede on ſtones. What a goodly ſonne of God art thou? How
fatherly doth he behaue himſelfe toward thee? He ſendeth thee not ſo much
as a peece of breade, but ſuffreth thee here to be pined with hunger. Go now,
and beleeue yet that thou art the ſonne of God, and he thy Father. Surely
with theſe and ſuch like cogitations he tempteth all the children of God,
which <pb n="341" facs="tcp:9413:179"/> Chriſt alſo vndoutedly felt, for he was not a
blocke or ſtone, but verie man, although pure from ſynne, as he alſo
continued, which is not giuen vnto vs. Now that the Deuel tempted Chriſt with
care of the bellie, diffidence and wicked deſire, the aunſwere of Chriſt
doth ſufficiently declare: <hi>Man liueth not by breade alone.</hi> Which is
as much as if he had ſaid: Thou wilt haue me haue regard to bread alone, thou
dealeſt with me, as though I ought to haue no other care but of meate and
foode for the bellie. This tentation is verie common,<note place="margin">An
vſuall thinge to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted with care for the belly.</note> euen among men
that are of the moſt perfect ſort, but they eſpecially feele it, which
when they are poore, haue notwithſtanding a wife and children to nouriſh
and maintaine, and therewithall an emptie houſe. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Paule calleth
couetouſnes the roote of all euels, for that it is the right ofſpring of
diffidence. And what thinge els, but this diffidence and care of the bellie, is
the cauſe that many are ſo loath to marie? what els doth hold ſo many
thouſand men in whoredom &amp; vnchaſt liuing, and detaineth them from
matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but this immoderate care of the bellie, and vngodly feare leſt
they ſhould be pined and perich with hunger? But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deede and
example of Chriſt ſhould be thought vpon, who although he had bin without
meate fortie dayes and ſo many nights, yet was he not quite forſaken and
left deſtitute, but the Angels at the laſt came, and miniſtred all
thinges neceſſarie vnto him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we may ſee here how Chriſt meeteth with this
ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the bellie, and ouercometh it. He ſeeth nothing in deede but
ſtones and that which can not be eaten, therefore from thoſe thinges that
were before his eyes he remoueth his minde to the worde of God, thereby both
ſtrengthening himſelfe, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Deuell. On which word
Chriſtians,<note place="margin">How Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they are tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pted with
pouerty and neede muſt comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ouercome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
tentation.</note> eſpecially when pouertie preſſeth them, and all thinges
ſeeme to be turned into ſtones, and the minde doth now tremble for feare of
hunger, ought with a ſtrong faith to lay hold, and aunſwere the tentation
that would quite diſcourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: What if the whole world were full of bread?
yet doth not man liue by bread alone, there is neede of an other thinge, that
is, of the word of God. Now foraſmuch as theſe wordes are of meruelous
force and efficacie, we muſt a litle ſtand vpon them, and endeuour to
declare them, &amp; not lightly paſſe them ouer. Theſe wordes therefore
Chriſt tooke out of <pb n="342" facs="tcp:9413:180"/> the firſt booke of Moſes chap.
8. where Moſes ſpeaketh thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſraelites:<note place="margin">Deut. 8.3.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord thy God humbled thee, and
ſuffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with Manna, which neither thou nor thy
fathers knew of, to make thee know that a man doth not liue by bread onely, but
by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi> Which is as
much as if he had ſaid: Whereas he ſuffered thee to hunger, and yet thou
didſt not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, thou mayſt thereby eaſily know, that it is God which
ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thee by his word euen without bread. For if we did liue and
were nouriſhed by bread alone, it were neceſſarie that we ſhould be
alwayes filled with bread. But it is the word of God that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth vs,
which he will haue preached, that we may knowe that he is our God, and that he
will ſhew himſelfe bountifull and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vnto vs.<note place="margin">He
that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth in the word of God ſhall both be ſuſtained in the time of
hunger, and at the laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly haue foode ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</note> We
are taught therefore by this aunſwere of Chriſt, and teſtimonie of
Moſes, that he which beleeueth in the word of God, ſhall vndoutedly haue
experience of two thinges. Firſt, that when meate is wanting, and he is
pinched with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he is as well ſuſtained and ſtrengthened by this
word, that he die not or periſh with hunger, as if he might aboundantly
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye meate, this word of God, which he obtaineth in heart, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and
ſtrengthening him without meat and drinke. And if he haue but a litle meat,
he ſhall perceiue that litle, although it were but euen one peece of breade,
to feede and nouriſh him no leſſe, then if he did enioy princely fare.
For not by bread, but by the word of God the body is nouriſhed and
preſerued, like as by it it was made, as alſo all other thinges, like as by
the word they were created, ſo alſo by it are they preſerued. The other
thing, which we are here taught that the beleeuer ſhall haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of,
is, that at the length he ſhall aſſuredly receiue bread, from whence ſo
euer it come, yea although it ſhould raine downe from heauen, as Manna did to
the Iſraelites, in a place where no other breade could be gotten. Let a
Chriſtian quietly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to himſelfe and looke for theſe two thinges,
his hope can not be fruſtrate, either he ſhall haue in hunger ſomewhat to
eate, from whence ſoeuer it be giuen him, or his hunger ſhalbe made ſo
tolerable vnto him, that he ſhalbe no leſſe fedde, then if he were fedde
with breade, the power of the word of God nouriſhing and ſuſtaining him.
Thoſe thinges that I haue ſaid of bread that is, of meat, are alſo to be
vnderſtood of drinke, apparell, <pb n="343" facs="tcp:9413:180"/> houſe, and all
thinges neceſſarie vnto this life.</p>
            <p>It may be in deede that a godly man do neede apparell,<note place="margin">Singular com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort againſt pouertie and neede.</note> or an
houſe, &amp;c. but at length he ſhall haue them. The leaues falling from
the trees ſhall ſooner be turned into coats and clokes, then we can be left
naked, or ſurely thoſe garments which we haue ſhall not wax olde, which
the Iſraelites tried, whoſe clothes and ſhoes in the deſert were not
torne, as alſo a moſt wide wildernes was vnto them in ſteede of houſes,
places vnpaſſable, paſſable, vnwaterie, waterie, finally the ſtonie
rockes, fountaines of water. For the Word of God ſtandeth ſure and
vnmoueable: <hi>The Lord is carefull for vs.</hi> And Paule ſayth:<note place="margin">1.
Pet. 5.7. 1. Tim. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>God giueth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly all thinges to
enioye.</hi> Alſo Chriſt ſayth Matth. 6: <hi>Seeke firſt the kingdome
of God, and all thinges shalbe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto you, onely be carefull for
nothing.</hi> Such wordes and promiſes of God muſt needes remaine true for
euer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no good thinge can be wanting to them that beleeue. This
euen daily experience may teach vs. We ſee commonly poore folkes and their
children to be better liking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many rich folkes and their children, for that
the vſe of their ſmall ſuſtenaunce is by the bleſſing of God
encreaſed, and doth much more feede and nouriſh them, then all that moſt
aboundant ſubſtaunce doth feede and nourich the rich. Now, whereas the
wicked do ſometime ſuffer neede, or in the time of famine ſome do euen
die through hunger, that is the ſpeciall vengeance of God, as is alſo the
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, warre and ſuch like. Otherwiſe it plainly appeareth, that
not meat but God doth feede and ſuſtaine vs.</p>
            <p>Howbeit whereas God feedeth the world with bread, and not with his
word alone without bread, he therefore doth it,<note place="margin">It pleaſeth
God to work by ordinarie meanes, yet of no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</note> that he may
ſo hide his worke, and exerciſe our faith. So he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the
Iſraelites, that they ſhould prepare themſelues to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and yet he
would not haue the victorie to be gotten by their ſword and labour: but he
himſelfe would by meanes of their ſword and labour ouercome and vanquiſhe
the enemies. Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it might be ſaid, that the ſouldier doth ſlaie
and ouercome the enemie, not by his ſword alone, but by the word which
procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of the mouth of God. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dauid ſayth Pſal. 44: <hi>I
will not truſt in my bow, it is not my ſword that can ſaue me.</hi> And
againe, <hi>He is not delighted in any mans legges:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 147.10.</note> 
               <hi>a man of great might is not deliuered
by much ſtrength: a horſe is but a <pb n="344" facs="tcp:9413:181"/> vaine thing to
ſaue a man, &amp;c.</hi> Neuertheles God vſeeh men, ſwordes, horſes,
and bowes, howbeit not by the power and ſtrength of them, but by them as by
certaine meanes or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he himſelfe fighteth &amp; ouercometh.
This he hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared oftentimes, when he hath ouerthrowen the
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and deliuered his people, which ſuerly he daily doth, when the
caſe ſo requireth. After the ſame ſort God vſeth bread alſo, by it,
foraſmuch as it is made for that vſe, he feedeth vs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit when it is
wanting, he neuertheles feedeth them that be his, euen by his word, without
bread, as he doth at other times by bread, ſo that bread doth as it were
worke vnder God, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and preachers of the word in ſpirituall
and euangelicall meat ſerue vnder him, as it is mentioned 1. Cor. 3. For as
God vſeth their miniſterie to teache men,<note place="margin">A
ſimilitude.</note> he himſelfe by his ſpirit ſpeaking in their hearts
through it, and doing all thinges alone, which he both is able to do, and often
times wont to do without the miniſterie of the preachers of his word,
although he will not in the meane ſeaſon haue the miniſterie of his to be
deſpiſed, and ſo himſelfe tempted: ſo to the nouriſhing of our
outward man, he outwardly vſeth bread, although he doth make by his word
inwardly, that we be nouriſhed and ſtrengthened, which he can as well do,
and is wont to do when bread is awaye, that all our nouriſhment may be
attributed to the word, and not to bread, which he vſeth as an inſtrument,
but yet of no neceſſitie. That I may ſpeake briefly, all creatures do as
it were ſerue vnder him, and are his inſtruments, without which
notwithſtanding he is able, and often times wont to worke: by this meanes
prouiding, that we may depend on his word alone, neither truſting more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, when we haue breade and other thinges which our life vſeth, neither
leſſe when we want them, but may vſe them with giuing of thankes when he
beſtoweth them vpon vs, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, may patiently be without them,
being certain neuertheles, that we ſhall liue and be nouriſhed in both
times, both when we haue them, and when we haue them not. And by this faith
that vain and vngodly care of the bellie, greedie deſire of thinges, and
carefulnes of life are ouercome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Tentation whereby we are moued to tempt God
with preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>
               <hi>Then the Deuell tooke him vp into
the holie Citie, &amp;c.</hi> This tentation is quite contrarie to the former.
He aſſaileth vs with ſuch tentation alſo whereby he goeth about to moue
vs to tempt <pb n="345" facs="tcp:9413:181"/> God, euen as he willeth Chriſt to caſt
him ſelf downe from a pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the temple, and ſo tempt God, when there
were ladders, by which he might deſcend. And that this tentation prouoketh to
tempt God, it is manifeſt euen by the aunſwere of Chriſt, who
aunſwereth Satan in this maner: <hi>It is written: Thou shalt not tempt the
Lorde thy God.</hi> Hereby he ſignifieth that the deuill would prouoke him to
tempt God. Now this tentation doth not amis follow the former. For when the
deuil perceiueth the hart, that in pouertie and neceſſitie it truſteth in
God, he by and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an end of tempting by care of the bellie and deſire
of things, as being weaker then that by it he may ouerthrow one ſo ſtronge
in faith. He thinketh therefore with him ſelfe: If he profeſſe him
ſelfe to be of ſo religious and aſſured a minde, I will on this ſide
alſo giue occaſion to ſinne. And ſo he ſetteth vpon him on the right
ſide, affirming that that is to be beleeued, which the Lorde hath neither
ſpoken, nor commaunded to be beleeued. As is this: If he ſhould bring thee
to ſuch madnes, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt bread at home giuen thee of God, as he
of his goodnes giueth vnto vs euery day, thou wouldeſt not vſe it, but
wouldeſt procure to thy ſelfe neceſſitie and hunger, ſaying: I muſt
truſt in God, I wil not feede on this earthly bread, I will tarye till God
giue me other from heauen. This were to tempt God. For he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
thee to beleeue, that that thing ſhal come vnto thee wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou haſt
neede, if it be already come of his liberalitie. For why ſhouldeſt thou
beleeue that he will giue that, which thou haſt already of his gift? Thou
ſeeſt therefore that the deuill doth here obiect a certaine neceſſitie
and neede vnto Chriſt, where there is none. For there was a ſufficient
meane to deſcende from the pinnacle of the temple, neither was it reaſon to
attempt this newe vnaccuſtomed and vnneceſſary meane whereunto Satan
perſuaded.</p>
            <p>Moreouer allegorically we may by this doing of Satan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his
craft and ſuttletie. <hi>He tooke Ieſus,</hi> ſayth the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,
<hi>into the holy Citie, and ſet him on a pinnacle of the temple.</hi> By
this tentation he repleniſheth men with cogitations that ſeeme moſt
holy,<note place="margin">Satan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
holines.</note> that they may thinke them ſelues moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endued
with faith, and to ſtande in a very holy place, when as notwithſtanding
they are ſette not in the temple, but on the temple, that is, not in the
ſynceritie of fayth, but in a vayne <pb n="346" facs="tcp:9413:182"/> outward ſhew of
faith. Neuertheles he is in the meane ſeaſon in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy citie, becauſe
that this kind of men is wont to be no where but among Chriſtians, where the
word of the Lord and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of faith is daily heard, who alſo like
vnto Satan, haue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Scripture in a readines as concerning the
wordes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they alwayes peruert &amp; wreſt them to their owne errour
and falſe imaginations. So Satan recited here vnto Chriſt out of the 91
Pſalme, that God doth commaund his Angels concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his children, that they
keepe them, lifting them vp with their hands. But the deceiuer concealed that
which is added, that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11.</note> in
their wayes. For thus hath the Pſalme: <hi>He will giue his Angells charge
ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes, &amp;c.</hi> So that the cuſtodie
of Angells is not by the commaundement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto vs, vnles we walke in
our wayes which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vs. If we walke in them, we ſhal
aſſuredly be kept of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells. Howbeit the deuill ſayth nothing of the
wayes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, but promiſeth by corrupting the ſaying of the Pſalme,
that it is commaunded to the Angells, to keepe vs in what wayes ſoeuer,
whereof the Lorde hath commaunded nothing. And this is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ſeducing, and
perſuaſion to tempt God.</p>
            <p>But this tentation doth not eaſily happen in theſe outward
thinges, as are bread, apparell, houſes, &amp;c. Thou mayſt finde in deed
ſome raſh heads, which for no cauſe do put their life, goods, good name
in great daunger, as they doe which goe on warfare of their owne accord, which
leape raſhly into moſt deepe waters, or goe voluntarily into other no
ſmall daungers. Of whom Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach ſayth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccle.</hi> 3.27.</note> 
               <hi>He that loueth perill, shall
perish in it.</hi> Whereof the Germanes haue a prouerbe: Selfe do, ſelf haue:
what euery one followeth, that he commeth vnto. So is it almoſt vſuall,
that none are oftner drowned then they that are moſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in
ſwimming, and none fal more perilouſly, then they which vſe to attempt
hie matters.<note place="margin">We are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt God by not
ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the vſe of outward things which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs.</note> But he
ſhall be hardly founde, which hauing a falſe and ouermuch confidence in
God, attempteth any ſuch thing, or vſeth not the thinges preſent, as
bread, apparell, houſe, and ſuch like, loking with perill, while God
prouide other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for him by miracle. We read of a certaine Heremite, who
becauſe he had vowed to take bread of no men, brought him ſelfe into perill
by hunger, and ſo periſhed, and vndoutedly went ſtrait vnto hell,
becauſe of that falſe faith and tempting of God, which 
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:9413:182"/> he learned no other where but of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deuill, ſo that
his madnes was altogither like that, whereunto Satan here perſuadeth
Chriſt, to wit, that he ſhoulde caſt him ſelfe downe from a pinnacle of
the temple. Howbeit thou ſhalt finde very few which doe follow this Heremite,
and doe differre to enioy corporall thinges preſent for that they hope that
God will giue them other from heauen.</p>
            <p>But in ſpirituall things, which concerne the nouriſhment,<note place="margin">We are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and often by the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan brought to
refuſe the true ſpiritual foode of our ſoules, and to ſeeke other
contrary to the will and word of God</note> not of the body, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſoule, this tentation is wont to be both migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and often. In theſe God
hath appoynted a certayne maner, wherby the ſoule may be fedde, nouriſhed
and ſtrengthened, both moſt commodiouſly, and alſo moſt
bleſſedly, ſo that no good thing at all can be wanting vnto it. This
nouriſhment, this ſtrength, this ſaluation, is Chriſt our Sauiour, in
whom the Father hath moſt abundantly offered and giuen all good thinges. But
there are very few which deſire him, the moſte parte ſeeke ſome other
where, whereby their ſoules may liue, &amp; obtaine ſaluation. Such are all
they which ſeeke ſaluation by their works. Theſe are they whom Satan
hauing ſette on a pinnacle of the temple, biddeth them caſt them ſelues
downe, and they obey him. They deſcende where as is no way: that is, they
beleeue and truſt in God, yet ſo, as they truſt alſo in their owne
works, in which is no place at all for faith and truſt, no way or path vnto
God, wherefore throwing them ſelues downe headlong, they breake their necke,
falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vtter deſperation.</p>
            <p>Now Satan perſuadeth miſerable men vnto this madnes, as alſo
he perſuaded Chriſt to caſt him ſelfe downe from a pinnacle of the
temple, by places of Scripture peruerted and miſapplied, wherein workes are
commaunded, whereby he maketh them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the Angells ſhall keepe
them, that is, that they ſhall be approued of God, when as in deede they can
by nothing ſo offend him, as by that madde truſt and confidence in workes.
For they acknowledge not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Scripture doth no where require works without
faith, or that it doth euery where require a ſound &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith from
which works proceede. We haue at large declared who are ſuch, namely,
incredulous hypocrites, which are giuen to workes without faith, which
falſely boaſt of the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, chalenging to them ſelues to
be chiefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flock of Chriſt: For this tentation muſt be in the holy
citie. Now theſe two ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the cauſes of them doe greatly
differ: In the former <pb n="348" facs="tcp:9413:183"/> the cauſe why men doe not
beleeue is neede and hunger, for they are thereby moued to diſtruſt God,
and deſpeire of his goodnes. In the latter the cauſe why they doe not
beleeue is ouermuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, for that miſerable men are full of moſt
plentifull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant treaſure, ſo that they loath it, coueting to haue
ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeciall thinge, whereby they may procure the ſaluation of
their ſoules. So our caſe ſtandeth ill in both reſpects: If we haue
nothinge we deſpeire, and diſtruſt God: If we haue plentie of thinges, we
loath them, and require other, being then alſo voyde of faith. Concerning the
firſt, we flie and hate ſcarſitie and ſeeke plentie: concerning the
latter, we ſeeke ſcarſitie, and flie plentie. Howſoeuer God dealeth
with vs, we are not content: our incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie is a bottomles pit of malice and
vngodlines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe the deuil tooke him vp into an exceeding high
mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tentation by vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, pleaſures and
delights of the world.</note> Here he tempteth with vaine glorie &amp; power of
the world, as by the wordes of the deuil doth plainly appeare, who ſhewing
Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdoms of the world, offered them to him, if he would worſhip
him. By this tentation they are ouercome which reuolt from faith, that they may
enioy glorie and power here, or at leaſt doe ſo temper their faith that
they loſe not theſe thinges. In the number of theſe are all heretikes and
troublers of the Church, which do therfore either leaue, or oppugne the
ſinceritie of faith, that being exempted out of the common number they may be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled on hie. So we may place this tentation on the right hand, as the
firſt aſſaileth vs on the left. For as the firſt tentation is of
aduerſitie, whereby we are moued to indignation, impatiencie, &amp;
diffidence, ſo this third tentation is of proſperitie, whereby we are
prouoked to delights, glory, pleaſures, and whatſoeuer is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and
delectable in the world. The ſecond tentation is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither ſpirituall,
whereby Satan by deceit, and meruelous &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſuttlery goeth about
to withdraw man from faith. For whom he can not ouercome with pouertie,
ſcarſitie, neceſſitie, &amp; miſery, them he te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth with riches,
fauour, glorie, delights, power, &amp;c: &amp; ſo he aſſayleth vs on
either ſide, yea when he preuaileth by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, he goeth about, as Peter
ſaith, &amp; atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth all meanes, that whom he can ouercome neither by
aduerſitie, that is, by the firſt tentation, nor by proſperitie, that is,
by the thirde tentation, he may ouercome either by errour, blindnes, or falſe
vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture, that is, by the ſecond tentation which is 
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:9413:183"/> ſpirituall, and therefore moſt hurtfull. By which if
he preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any they are alſo ouercome both on the left ſide and
on the right. For whether they ſuffer ſuch pouertie, or enioy plenty of
thinges, whether they contend, or yeelde vnto all thinges, both is nothing:
while they are in errour, either patience in aduerſitie or conſtancie in
proſperitie can be of no importance. For in both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heretikes often tymes
doe notably excell, and it is a practize of the deuill eftſoones to fayne him
ſelfe ouercome in the firſt and third tentation, that he may reigne victour
by the ſecond. He can be content that they that be his doe often tymes
ſuffer pouertie patiently, and doe alſo contemne the world, although they
do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both with a ſimple hart, and ſincere faith. Euery one
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of theſe three tentations is grieuous and very hard, but the middle
one is moſt perilous of all, for it aſſayleth the doctrine of faith, and
is ſpirituall, and wont to deceiue in ſpirituall thinges. The other two
alſo doe aſſayle faith, howebeit in theſe outward thinges, as
aduerſitie &amp; proſperitie, although they doe alſo vrge vs very ſore.
For it can not be a litle grieuous to ſuffer pouerty, to want bread, and
ſuch other thinges neceſſary. Agayne it is no leſſe grieuous to
neglect, &amp; wholy to denye fauour, glory, riches, friendes, companions, and
other commodities which we haue. But an entire and ſound faith in the worde
of God can performe both notably, and if it be a ſtrong faith,<note place="margin">An entire &amp; ſound faith can both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently beare
aduerſitie &amp; contemne the vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry &amp; delights of the world</note>
they ſeeme very eaſie and delectable vnto it.</p>
            <p>We can not certainly know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of theſe tentations which
happened to Chriſt, for that the Euangeliſts haue not deſcribed them
after one order. For Luke hath ſet that laſt, which Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew hath ſet in
the middes, &amp; that which Matthew hath ſet laſt, Luke hath placed in the
middes. But there doth not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the order.
Notwithſtanding when any wil teach the people concerning theſe tentations,
it were better to follow the order of Luke. For he may fitly ſay, and thus
rehearſe, that Satan doth firſt tempt vs with pouertie and aduerſitie,
wherby if he preuaile not, that he tempteth vs with proſperity and glory,
which if he do in vaine, that he aſſaileth vs with all his might, and
tempteth vs with errour, lyes, deluſion, and other ſpiritual ſuttleties.
Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this order alwayes obſerued of Satan: but he tempteth
Chriſtians ſometime with the firſt, ſometime with the third ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as he hath and ſeeth occaſion. Matthew was not careful to 
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:9413:184"/> rehearſe them in that order, which they haue almoſt
by their own nature, and which may be commodious for him that ſhall teach of
them. Yea it may be that they happened not vnto Chriſt by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certain order,
but that he was aſſailed of Satan one day with this, an other day with
that, during the ſpace of thoſe forty daies, as Satan thought it moſt
conuenient and meete for his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And behold, the Angells came, &amp; miniſtred vnto him.</hi>
This I thinke was done corporally, that they hauing taken bodies, appeared, and
miniſtred vnto him meate and drinke, as his ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at the table, and
Miniſters of all other thinges neceſſary for his life. Yea and I thinke
that the deuill alſo appeared vnto him in a corporall forme, perhaps as an
Angell. For in that he tooke Chriſt, and ſet him on a pinnacle of the
temple: alſo wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a moment he ſhewed him all the kingdoms of the
world, he ſufficiently declared, that he was more then a man, &amp; ſuch a
one ſurely he ſhewed him ſelfe openly, when he offered that he would giue
vnto him thoſe kingdoms, and required that he would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him. And
vndoutedly he did not appeare like a deuill when he did theſe thinges, for he
loueth to appeare after a fayre ſort, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when he will lie and
deceiue:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</note> for then he
transformeth him ſelfe into an Angell of light, as Paule witneſſeth. Now
this is written chiefly for our conſolation,<note place="margin">In the time of
tentation we muſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dout of Gods help and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> that we
may not dout, that many Angells ſhall miniſter vnto vs, when one deuill
tempteth vs, if we fight valiantly. For if we ſtand faſt in faith, it is
ſo farre of that God will ſuffer vs to be troubled and pinched with
pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, more then is meete, that he will ſooner ſend his Angells to
miniſter vnto vs, to be our Butlers, our Cookes, and to helpe vs with their
miniſterie in all neceſſitie. Neither are theſe thinges written for
Chriſtes cauſe, whome they can not profit, but they are written for vs,
that we may learne to beleeue, that if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells miniſtred vnto him, they
ſhall alſo when the caſe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth miniſter vnto vs his brethren
and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Lord giue vs faith to beleeue this.</p>

               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:9413:185"/>THis text is exhortatorie, wherein Paule,
according to his maner, and accuſtomed care for the brethren, exhorteth
Chriſtians not to leaue or ſlack the ſtudy and care of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and
giue them ſelues to ſlothfulnes, but to declare by their worke the word
that they haue learned of him, that is, to ſhew it forth by the frutes of
faith, and make it plauſible and honorable, to the edifying of the Heathen,
leſt that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vices of them which profeſſe the doctrine of the
Goſpell, they take occaſion to hate that doctrine, and ſo be offended by
them, whom it did behoue to winne them vnto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be ye therfore followers of God as deare children.</hi>
Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorteth vs, foraſmuch as we are by Chriſt made the
ſonnes of God, to imitate ſuch a father, as deare children. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous
gently &amp; alluringly he ſpeaketh vnto vs, calling vs deare children, that
by the loue of God our father toward vs, he may prouoke vs to loue him again,
and them whom he commaundeth vs to loue,<note place="margin">The loue of God
toward vs.</note> euen as he hath loued vs firſt. But howe hath he loued vs?
Surely not after that common ſort alone, wherby in this life he nouriſheth
and ſuſtaineth vs being vnworthy, togither with al the vngodly, making his
ſunne to ariſe on the good, and on the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, and ſending rayne on the
iuſt and vniuſt: wherof Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Matth. 5: <hi>Be ye perfect as
your Father is perfect.</hi> But he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs alſo after an other ſpeciall
maner, in that he hath giuen his ſonne for vs. Ioh. 3. For he hath
aboundantly beſtowed vpon vs all temporall and alſo eternall good things,
yea his owne ſelf, and hath as it were poured him ſelfe, with all that he
is, hath, and can, into vs who were ſinners, vnworthy, enemies, and
ſeruaunts of Satan, ſo that he could not doe and giue vnto vs more &amp;
grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thinges. Now he, whom this diuine fire of loue, which filleth heauen
and earth, and yet is not comprehended, doth not kindle &amp; inflame to loue
likewiſe his neighbour, whoſoeuer he be, friend, or enemy, he I ſay, wil
neither by law, precepts, doctrine, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and force be euer moued to
godlines &amp; loue. <hi>VValke,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>in loue,</hi>
whereby he ſignifieth that our life ſhould be nothing els,<note place="margin">In what kind of loue we muſt walke.</note> but meere loue.
Howbeit he will not haue vs walke in the loue of the world, which in loue
ſeeketh thoſe things which are his owne, and loueth ſo long as there is
any thing, wherby it looketh for commoditie and lucre. Therefore he ſayth:
<hi>Euen as Chriſt hath loued vs,</hi> who neither ſought nor could looke
for any <pb n="353" facs="tcp:9413:185"/> profit or commoditie of vs, and yet he loued vs
ſo greatly that he gaue him ſelfe for vs, and not onely his other good
things which he giueth vs daily, and he ſo gaue him ſelfe for vs, that he
might be an oblation and ſacrifice, to obtayne the good will and fauour of
the father toward vs, and to bring to paſſe, that we might now haue God a
mercifull and fauourable father, being become his true children and heires,
&amp;c. So alſo it behoueth vs to giue and lend, not onely to our friendes,
but alſo to our enemies, neither to count this ſufficient, but to be ready
alſo euen to dye both for friendes and foes, thinking nothing elſe, but
that we may ſerue and profit our neighbours both in body and goods, as long
as we ſhall be in the pilgrimage of this life, ſeeing that we
poſſeſſe all thinges being giuen vnto vs by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be an offering and a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmelling
ſauour to God.</hi> This maner of ſpeech Paul borowed out of the old
Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, wherein thoſe corporall ſacrifices are written eftſoones to
haue yeelded to the Lorde a ſweete ſauour, that is, to haue bene acceptable
vnto him.<note place="margin">The ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſake, who was to come. Chriſt the onely
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by we are acceptable vnto
him.</note> Notwithſtanding that was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the worke and
ſacrifice in it ſelfe, as the Iewes falſely thought, &amp; therefore were
very often reproued of the Prophets, but for Chriſtes ſake who was to come,
the one and onely ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a good ſauour, whom all thoſe
ſacrifices of the lawe did ſhadow forth, and repreſent. Wherefore that
which Paule here ſayth, is as much as if he had ſayd: All the ſacrifices
of the olde Teſtament haue an ende, they can nowe be of no price: Chriſt
him ſelfe is the onely ſacrifice, which yeeldeth vnto God a ſweete
ſmelling ſauour, that is, is pleaſing and acceptable vnto him, whereby we
are aſſured that we are acceptable vnto God, and do pleaſe him. Wherefore
there is no other ſacrifice in the Church which may be offered for vs,
beſide this onely ſacrifice, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once offered hath at once
ſatisfied for the ſinnes of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. And although we after the
example of this ſacrifice, doe offer our bodies to God, as Paule teacheth
Rom. 12, yet we offer them not either for our ſelues or for other,
foraſmuch as that is proper to Chriſt, the onely ſacrifice, whereby the
ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all is obtayned. Wherefore thoſe thinges ſmell moſte
ſtinkingly before God, whatſoeuer men offer with this mind, as though they
would ſatisfie for their own ſinnes, or for the ſinnes of other, whereof
we both haue and will elſewhere ſpeake more.</p>

               <hi>But fornication, and all vncleannes, or
couetouſnes, let it not be once named among you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vncleannes.</note> By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of vncleannes beſide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
he vnderſtandeth all luſt &amp; lecherous filthines, which is committed out
of matrimonie, which for the filthines of them he doth not vouchſafe to
rehearſe by name, as Rom. 1. he ſpeaketh very groſſely of them.
Although in matrimonie alſo a meane may be exceeded, &amp; it is the dutie of
Chriſtians ſo to moderate the vſe of mariage, that they require &amp;
performe due loue &amp; beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce only for auoiding fornication, but we are
fallen ſo farre, that they are moſt rare, which come togither onely for
procreation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and to auoid fornication, which ſurely were beſt,
and ſhould very well become vs. Nowe the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>let it not be
once named among you,</hi> that is, be ſo farre from theſe euils, that they
may not ſo much as be ſpoken of of you.<note place="margin">There is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
falling among Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s through infirmitie, &amp; how true Chriſtians
deale in this caſe.</note> Albeit it will neuer come to paſſe in this
exile, that none among Chriſtians be weake, &amp; do not oftentimes fall, yet
true Chriſtians will neuer winke at thoſe things: they will reproue, amend,
put away, couer, &amp; cure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſuch thing ſhal burſt forth
amongſt them, that the heathen may not be offended and ſay: See what vices
the Chriſtians ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer among them ſelues, howe vncleane and lewde a life
doe they leade? thinking that all their whole life is defiled with like vices
as is their owne. We muſt needes confeſſe that among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſome
doe eftſoones fal, which we muſt needes beare, it is wel if onely the
better part liueth well, &amp; winketh not at their ſinnes, neither teacheth
them, but rather reproueth and amendeth them. So Paule exhorteth Gal. 6. that
they which are ſpirituall wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them that offend, with the ſpirit
of meekenes. And he ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproueth the Corinthians, for that they did
lightly paſſe ouer many ſinnes of certaine perſons. For ſinne being
reprehended &amp; puniſhed, is now counted as no ſinne, neither can the
Church be blamed becauſe of it. After the ſame ſort heede muſt be
taken, that couetouſnes be not named among Chriſtians, that is, that they
become not infamous by the name thereof, which they ſhal bring to paſſe,
if, when it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth that couetous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be amongſt them, or one vſeth
deceit toward an other in their buſines and affaires, or ſome contend in
iudgement for thoſe outward things, if I ſay, they doe not winke hereat,
but do reproue &amp; correct ſuch, that the ſinceritie of the doctrine of
the Goſpell may obtaine due eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the people, &amp; there may
be no cauſe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to diſpraiſe <pb n="355" facs="tcp:9413:186"/> our miniſterie,
2. Cor. 6. Theſe things I haue ſpoken becauſe of them, who as ſoone as
they ſee that all thinges do not reſemble &amp; ſhew forth a holines
among Chriſtians, &amp; that ſome doe ſtumble &amp; fall, do thinke that
there is no Chriſtian left, that the Goſpel is to no purpoſe, &amp; that
all things are taught and done in vaine. As though the life of Chriſtians
were nowe without fight, victorie &amp; due triumph ouer ſinne being
obtained, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as rather it is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and a continuall fight. Where as
therefore they do now ſight and are in the campe, it is no meruell if ſome
flie away, if ſome be wounded, if ſome fal, yea &amp; be euen ſlaine
outright. Warre is not made without perill and hurt, if it be earneſt
warre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As it becommeth Saincts.</hi> This he addeth to his
exhortation,<note place="margin">Chriſtians are Saincts, &amp; therefore muſt
be pure, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with vncleannes, couetouſnes, &amp;c.</note> as a
reaſon &amp; cauſe ſhewing why it lieth vpon Chriſtians, to take heede
that they be not diffamed by theſe names: For they are Saincts, now it
becommeth ſuch to be chaſt, bountiful, &amp; ready to giue, to teach and
doe the ſame. Thou ſeeſt here, that Paul cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Chriſtians Saincts,
while they remain yet in this life, &amp; are preſſed with fleſh &amp;
blood, from which nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth but ſinne, which he doth vndoutedly not for
their good workes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſanctifying bloode of Chriſt, as
he witneſſeth 1. Cor 6: <hi>But ye are washed, but ye are sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified, but
ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, &amp; by the Spirit of our
God.</hi> Foraſmuch therefore as we are Saincts, it is meete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould
ſhew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame in our workes, &amp; albeit we be as yet weake, neuertheles
we muſt daily endeuour to liue purely, &amp; farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couetouſnes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

            <p>

a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance is wont to be poured forth in Innes &amp; victailing hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in
the time of eating, drinking, &amp; playing. Theſe the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vſed very
freely and accuſtomably more then others, as their owne Poets &amp; other
writers do ſufficiently witnes. But he eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reproueth here thoſe
lewde and wanton wordes, which are ſpoken openly without ſhame, which
ſtirre vp wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt thoughts, and are cauſe of many offences,
eſpecially being ſpoken amonge youth, according to that ſaying:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33.</note> 
               <hi>Euill ſpeakings corrupt good
manners,</hi> as the Apoſtle writeth to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And if any
Chriſtians ſhould be ſo careles of their tongue, that ſuch wordes
ſhould come from them, ſuch muſt be chaſtiſed <pb n="356" facs="tcp:9413:187"/>
of the Church, and if they doe not amend, they muſt not be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
leſt becauſe of them the whole Church be ill reported of, as though theſe
things were either taught among Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be
vnpuniſhed, as it is wont to be among the Heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fooliſh tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</note>
               <hi>Neither foolish talking.</hi> Fables and other trifling
ſpeeches &amp; ieſts are called fooliſh talking, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecians
alſo were wont to vſe more then other nations, being very witty to inuent
ſuch vaine ſpeeches. Of this ſort are thoſe tales, which our women
&amp; maidens are wont to tell, ſpinning at the diſtaffe, alſo the termes
and verſes of iuglers and ſuch like fellowes, and many common ſonges,
which are partly euen filthy, &amp; partly containe other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and vaine
things. But eſpecially it is vnſeemely and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for Chriſtians
to vſe ſuch fooliſh and trifling talke, when they come togither to heare
the word of God, or to read and ſerch the Scriptures, and yet
notwithſtanding almoſt euen ſuch folly hapneth among them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many come
togither. For albeit they begin with ſerious matters, neuertheles they are
meruelous ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily brought vnto trifles: from earneſt and holy matters, to
ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and vaine ſpeeches, wherewith both the time is ſpent in vaine,
and better things are neglected. So haue they bene wont certaine yeares
hitherto, at euery feaſt of Eaſter in the tyme of preaching to tel ſome
ridiculous tale to ſtirre vp the people from ſleepe. They did not vnlike at
the feaſt of the natiuitie of Chriſt, vſing ſonges or carrolls, wherein
they ſayd, they made diſcourſes of the birth and infancie of Ieſus,
howbeit ridiculous meeter and wordes, mouing rather laughter then deuotion, as
they called it: Alſo they ſoong many fained fables of the wiſe men, whom
they made 3. Kings, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, of the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea, &amp; many other, all which were nothing but fooliſh talking &amp;
vain inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, altogither vnworthy of Chriſtians. To the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of theſe
I might well adde thoſe hiſtories of Saincts, which they call the legends,
and that flood of lies, of miracles and pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to images, and moniments
of Saincts, Maſſes, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippings of Saincts, indulgences and
innumerable other, not ſo much fooliſh as vngodly inuentions, which in the
aſſemblies of the Church, were wont to be chiefly extolled in the pulpit,
which were ſo contrary to godlines, that they deſerue much rather to be
called the wicked inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions of Satan, then fooliſh imaginations of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
they did not as ridiculous lies are wont to do, corrupt <pb n="357" facs="tcp:9413:187"/>
good maners onely, of which Paule ſpeaketh eſpecially here, but they did
wholy ouerthrow faith, and put out of place the word of God, ſo that they did
not only not beſeme Saincts, but did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboliſh all Sainctes. Thoſe
former therefore were fables and tales of men, which are not beleeued, neither
eſteemed any thing of, but rather laught at, although in the mean ſeaſon
they corrupt good maners, withdraw Chriſtians from ſerious matters, and
make them ſlack and ſlothful. But theſe latter are deuiliſh fables,
which are beleeued for a truth, and counted for ſerious, yea and heauenly
matters, when as notwithſtanding they be nothing els but fained deuiſes of
Satan, whereby he with his angells delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and mocketh vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither ieſting.</hi> Hereby he vnderſtandeth all
pleaſaunt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which they whom they call ieſters are wont to vſe,
to make men mery, which by pleaſaunt diſcourſes and mery tearmes doe moue
laughter &amp; ſtirre vp mens minds to mirth &amp; cheerefulnes, which is
wont to be vſuall in ciuill bankers, and when ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions meete
togither. This ieſting the Heathen counted for a vertue, eſpecially
Ariſtotle.<note place="margin">Ieſting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allowed nor vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> But Paul among Chriſtians giueth it place among vices.
For Chriſtians haue other ſpeeches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may recreat and cheere
them ſelues in Chriſt, which alſo do bring ſome profit with them,
although it eaſily hapneth, that many Chriſtians do offend oftentimes
herein. But they that are true Chriſtians, doe neuer praiſe it, neither doe
ſuffer that any ſhould giue him ſelfe to this ieſting, and ſtudy to
exceede therein, but they reproue and prohibit him, eſpecially in the Church,
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of preaching and teaching. For Chriſt hath witneſſed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36</note> that we ſhall in the laſt day
giue an account of euery idle worde. It is meete in deede that Chriſtians be
an elegant &amp; amiable people, but therewithall graue, that there may be
ſeene in them a ſeuere gentlenes, and a gentle ſeueritie, as the life of
Chriſt is deſcribed vnto vs in the Goſpells.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Things which are not comely, but rather giuing of
thankes.</hi> This comprehendeth all idle words, which want a proper name.<note place="margin">Idle wordes.</note> Now I call them idle words which make neither
to the edifying of faith, nor to the vſe of our corporall life. For there be
things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now both profitable and pleaſaunt, which when it pleaſeth vs to
ſpeake, we may talke of in the ſhort time of this life, as of Chriſt, of
loue, and other things either neceſſary or profitable. Whereof 
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:9413:188"/> Paule admoniſheth when he ſayth: <hi>but rather
giuing of thankes.</hi> For our daily ſpeech ought to be the praiſe of God,
and giuing of thankes to him, as well priuatly, as publikely in ſermons, for
ſuch infinite good thinges, as he hath giuen vnto vs in Chriſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnſpeakeable. But ſuch is the maner of our reaſon &amp; nature, that
neceſſary and profitable thinges are neglected, and fooliſh &amp;
friuolous things are chiefly regarded. Now marke here, if Paul doth not
ſuffer in Chriſtians ſpeeches that be onely pleaſant and tending to
mirth, what thinkeſt thou would he ſay of that peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t backebyting and
ſclaundering, which reigneth now in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men, euen them that be
priuate, when two oftentimes doe talke togither? Yea what would he ſay of
them, which openly in ſermons do as it were bite and rent one an other with
reprochful wordes, and maliciouſly accuſe and ſpeake euill one of an
other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, neither vncleane
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor couetous perſon, which is an idolater, hath any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God.</hi> In theſe wordes he doth very
plainly pronounce againſt them which are infected w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch vices, that they
are heathen vnder the name of Chriſtians, how many ſoeuer do not bring
forth the frutes of faith. This is a briefe and a certaine ſentence:<note place="margin">A fornicator an vncleane perſon and a couetous perſon haue
denied the faith. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</note> He that is a fornicator, hath
denied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith, an vncleane perſon hath denied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith, a couetous
perſon hath denied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith, all ſuch are Apoſtataes, periured, &amp;
traitours towards God: as Paul writeth alſo vnto Timothe, of him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth them that be of his familie: <hi>If there be any,</hi> ſayth he,
<hi>that prouideth not for his owne, &amp; namely for them of his houshold, he
denieth the faith, and is worſe then an Infidell.</hi> How could he more
ſeuerely and terribly fraie vs from vices? For he ſayth: <hi>For this ye
know,</hi> as if he ſayd: Do not ſo much as dout, count it not for a play,
neither let it be a ſport vnto you, neither comfort your ſelues with vaine
hope of a Chriſtian name, and for that ye are counted Chriſtians, theſe
thinges ſhall profit you no more, then it profited the Iewes, that they were
the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and Diſciples of Moſes. It was ſpoken to all
which Chriſt ſayth Matth. 7: <hi>Not euery one that ſayth vnto me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the will of my
Father which is in heauen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two very forcible meanes to
ſtirre vs vp vnto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> there is neede of doing, and our faith
muſt be proued by workes. Whom therefore that great force of heauenly fire
ſhall not enflame vnto godlines, that is, the <pb n="359" facs="tcp:9413:188"/>
admonition of the incomparable loue of God toward vs, which he ſet in the
firſt place, him let theſe horrible threatnings of hell fire moue, to wit,
whereas he witneſſeth, that as many as wil not follow God, and walke in
loue, and ſhew forth their faith by their workes, are neither the ſonnes of
God, nor heires of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereupon it followeth, that they are
vndoutedly heires with Satan of hell fire. Whom therefore theſe two ſo
mightie prouokements ſhall not ſtirre vp to the feare of God &amp;
godlines, with all diligence to doe the dutie of a Chriſtian, he is plainly a
blocke and a ſtone, hauing a hart harder then the anuill as Iob ſayth.</p>
            <p>He particularly reproueth a couetous perſon,<note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man an idolater.</note> and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him an
Idolater or worſhipper of images, whereby ſurely he declareth, how greatly
he is diſpleaſed with them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this vice, and in the
third chapter of his Epiſtle to the Coloſſians he ſayth alſo the
ſame thing of him. The cauſe hereof I thinke to be this: other ſinners
vſe onely that thinge, wherein they offend, and make it ſerue their luſt
and deſire: ſo the fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and vncleane perſon vſe their body to
pleaſure: the proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vſeth riches, learning, the fauour of men,
and ſuch like, vnto glory: onely this miſerable Idolater is a ſlaue to
his money and riches, and his ſinne is, that he ſpareth his money and
goods, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and hourdeth them vp, dareth not apply them neither to his owne
vſe, nor to the vſe of other, but doth plainly ſerue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them
as his god, and ſo much eſteemeth them, that he would ſooner loſe and
ſuffer to periſh the kingdome of God, then he would ſpende his money, or
giue the value of a ruſh toward the maintaining either of a preacher, or an
inſtructer of youth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the word of God and his kingdom might be
furthered. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much therefore as all the truſt and hope of ſuch a man
is repoſed in money, and not in God alone, who giueth him aboundantly whereby
to liue, money is worthely called his god, and he him ſelfe ſaid to be an
Idolater, and hath no inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen. What can be
inuented more filthy and peſtilent then this diſeaſe? Wo vnto thee,
incredulitie, howe an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hurtfull euill art thou?<note place="margin">We muſt take heede we be not deceiued with vaine

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let no man deceiue you with vaine wordes.</hi> Theſe are the
vaine wordes of them which extenuate and make light of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuch
like ſinnes, as though they were not greatly euill, <pb n="360" facs="tcp:9413:189"/> or
did ſo much offend God. There were not wanting Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Poets
among the Heathen, which counted all vſe of lecherie beſide onely
adulterie, lawfull, as a thing naturall, as is to vſe meate and drinke. So
ſayth Terence: It is not a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, beleeue me, for a yong man to follow
harlots, &amp;c. But this is to be ignorant of God, and to liue according to
the ſore of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, as the Gentiles were wont to doe. Moreouer
ſuch vaine words are thoſe, which albeit they haue ſome likelihood of
truth, yet in deede are trifling, and ſhall not excuſe any. So
couetouſnes doth not want a cloke and pretence for it ſelfe: for him that
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his owne with the diſcommoditie of others, they call a good
huſband, induſtrious, one that looketh to his buſines, although in the
meane while the poore periſh with hunger, or are otherwiſe afflicted aboue
their ſtrength. Wherefore ſuch ſpeeches are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and heathniſh, by
which loue is extinguiſhed, &amp; they which giue eare to them &amp; beleeue
them, are deluded with a vaine hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For, for ſuch things commeth the wrath of God vpon the
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience.</hi> This is an other light which we ought to
follow, leauing the obſcure light of reaſon, which doth not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemne fornication,<note place="margin">The wrath &amp; ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance of God
han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ouer fornicators, vncleane &amp; couetous per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons.</note>
vncleanes, couetouſnes, &amp;c. This our light witneſſeth, that for
ſuch things the wrath of God commeth vpon vnbeleeuers, whom he calleth the
children of diſobedience, and therefore can not abide to beleeue the word of
God, &amp; to giue them ſelues to the obedience of faith. This Paule
declareth 1. Cor. 10. by many examples, where he ſayth that a great part of
the people was ſlaine for fornication, of which deede is ſpoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Num. 25. For violence alſo, couetouſnes, and vncleannes, the whole world
was deſtroyed by the flood. Wherefore a ſufficient ſharpe, yea and a
certaine vengeance abideth them that are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with theſe
wickedneſſes. Now he calleth them the children of diſobedience, that is,
of incredulitie, which is as much as if he had ſayd: of them that haue
reuolted from the faith, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Chriſt. Hereby therefore we
ſee and learne, that he that doth not approue his faith by workes, is no
better then a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, yea worſe, inaſmuch as he hath renounced Chriſt,
and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the faith once receiued. For this cauſe therefore the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and wrath of God ſhal come vpon them that are ſuch, as we Germanes do now
trie, vnto whom God ſendeth abundantly the peſtilence, famine, &amp; cruell
warres. Let men take heede they giue <pb n="361" facs="tcp:9413:189"/> no eare to thoſe
deceiuers, which with vaine words promiſe that thoſe ſinnes ſhal
eſcape vnpuniſhed: Let thoſe ſlacke and ſlothfull Chriſtians
beware, who although they be not blinde Heathen, but know well that vncleannes
and couetouſnes are ſinnes, and thinke or teach no otherwiſe, do
neuertheles liue wickedly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vpon faith, whereby they hope that they
ſhall obtaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without workes, foraſmuch as workes do not
ſaue: Yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they verie well know, that faith without workes is a fained
faith, and that worthie frutes and good workes muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, where a
true and ſound faith is, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they liue ſecurely in their
ſynnes, preſuming of the grace and mercy of God, nothing fearing God and
his iudgement, when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is certaine, that God doth require
the mortification of the olde Adam, and good frutes of good trees. Although
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Paule ſpeaketh not here properly of theſe, but of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
thinke, and in vaine wordes teach, that fornication, couetouſnes, and ſuch
like are not ſynnes, as the blynde Heathen did, &amp; many do at this day
vnder the name of Chriſtians: yet is it to be feared, ſeing they liue no
better then the heathen do, &amp; be themſelues for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatours &amp; couetous
perſons, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhall feele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like vengeance of God with them, yea ſo
much more grieuous ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance, as they doe know more certainly that thoſe are
ſynnes, according to that ſaying Rom. 2: <hi>Thinkeſt thou this, O thou
man, that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt them which do ſuch thinges, and doeſt the fame,
that thou shalt eſcape the iudgement of God? after thine hardnes, and heart
that can not repent, thou heapeſt vnto thy ſelfe wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the daye
of wrath, &amp; of the declaration of the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be not therefore companions with them: For ye were once
darkenes, but are now light in the Lord: walke as children of light.</hi> So
Peter alſo ſayth, that it is ſufficient for vs, that we haue ſpent the
time paſt of our life after the luſt of the Gentiles, but from hence forth
ſhould haue nothing common with them, but ſpend the reſt of our life in
the ſeruice and worſhip of God.<note place="margin">They which are not yet
lightned by Chriſt, are blinde and ignorant, but they whom he hath
ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, doe know both God &amp; their duty toward him.</note> When we were
Gentiles, we knew not that theſe were ſynnes, we were ſo blynded through
incredulitie and ignorance of God. But after that we are made light in the
Lord, that is, lightned by Chriſt, we do not onely well vnderſtand what God
is, and what he requireth of vs, what ſynne and iniquitie is, but are alſo
able <pb n="362" facs="tcp:9413:190"/> now to be in ſteede of light vnto others, and to
teach them thoſe things which we haue learned. Such Paul ſaid the
Philippians were, that they ſhined as lights in the world in the middes of a
naughtie &amp; crooked nation. So before we were not onely darke, but darkenes
it ſelfe, inaſmuch as we were not onely ignorant and erred, but did alſo
bring other into the ſame darkenes, both by wordes and deedes. Let vs be
thankefull therefore to him, which hath called vs out of this darkenes into his
meruelous light, walking as the children of light, which Peter alſo
admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth vs to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the fruite of the Spirit is in all goodnes, and
righteouſnes, and truth.</hi> Foraſmuch as he hath here ſpoken of light,
it had ben more agreable to haue added, for the frute of light, as the Latin
editions haue, then of the Spirit, as it is read in the Greeke. Who knoweth,
whether the greekes coppies were here chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon this occaſion, for that
Paule in the Epiſtle to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians entreateth of the frutes of the
ſpirit? But this ſkilleth litle,<note place="margin">Goodnes.</note> of the
Spirit, and of light are all one in this place. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therefore is a fruite
either of the Spirit or of light, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to couetouſnes, whereby a
Chriſtian man is good, that is, profitable and beneficiall to others,<note place="margin">Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> ready to gratifie and do well to his
neighbours. Righteouſnes being a frute of the Spirit is contrarie to
couetouſnes. For it maketh that no man doth take awaye from an other that
which is his, either by violence, either by craft or guile,<note place="margin">Truth.</note> but that he endeuour rather to giue vnto euerie man
that which is his owne. Truth is a frute of the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to
hypocriſie &amp; lying, which requireth that a Chriſtian be true and
vncorrupte not onely in wordes, but alſo in his whole life, that he doe not
glorie of the name of a Chriſtian without workes, that he be not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a
Chriſtian, &amp; yet liue after the maner of the Heathen, in fornication,
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes, couetouſnes, and other vices, &amp;c. *** *</p>

vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, which ſetteth forth two thinges vnto vs, namely faith, and
temporall good thinges, &amp; faith, and eternall good thinges.<note place="margin">The faithful ſhall wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is neceſſary for the
ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this life.</note> Firſt it declareth vnto them that
beleeue in Chriſt, that they ſhal haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient wherewith to
ſuſteine themſelues euen in this life: which Chriſt ſheweth by this,
when he giueth ſo many fiſhes to Peter and his companions, as they durſt
not ſo much as deſire. So that Chriſt is carefull euen how to feede the
bellie, if that curſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie be not na hinderance thereunto. For
beholde S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and conſider his heart aright in your minde, then ſhall
ye fynde, that he did not ſo much as thinke, that he ſhould take ſo many
fiſhes. God therefore is preſent, and cauſeth fiſhes to come into the
nette, euen moe then they would haue wiſhed. By which example we are
admoniſhed that they ſhall haue ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe thinges that are
neceſſary for the ſuſtentation of this life, which do beleeue, but they
that do not beleeue can neuer be ſatiſfied, whereby they fall into all
kinde of vices. Hereunto pertaineth that which S. Paule ſayth 1. Tim. 6:
<hi>Godlines is great gaine, if a man be content with that he hath. For we
brought nothing into the world, and it is certaine, that we may cary nothing
out, therefore when we haue foode and rayment, let vs therewith be content. For
they that wilbe rich, fall into tentation and ſnares, and into many foolish
and noyſome luſtes, which drowne men <pb n="365" facs="tcp:9413:191"/> in perdition
&amp; deſtruction. For the deſire of money is the roote of all euell, which
while ſome luſted after, they erred from the faith, &amp; perced
themſelues through with many ſorrowes.</hi> This place of S. Paul plainly
declareth what foloweth our vnbeliefe,<note place="margin">Frutes of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.</note> to wit, that it traueleth to get ſubſtance, and
laboureth to be rich, and falleth into the tentation and ſnares of the
Deuell. But we can not ſee that, foraſmuch as it is ſpirituall. If we
could as well ſee the hurt, which it bringeth to ſpirituall thinges, as we
can ſee that which it bringeth to corporall and outward thinges, then were it
an eaſie matter to preach vnto vs. For wee ſee plainely in outward thinges,
how he that is giuen to the deſire of money, ſcrapeth and gathereth
togither, doth iniurie to all men, that he alone may gather togither and heape
vp many thinges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he may truſt and ſay: Well, nowe haue I goodes
enough. Whereby we may gather how vnkinde &amp; vnmerciful a couetous man is:
for he doeth good to no man, he ſheweth himſelfe gentle and kynde to no
man, he giueth nothing to any man, but looketh vnto his owne lucre and
commoditie.</p>
            <p>Now this is a curſed thing, that we can not ſo much as truſt
vnto the Lord, that he will feede our belly, thinking alwayes that we ſhall
periſh with hunger, when as notwithſtanding we ſhall haue thinges
neceſſarie and that which is ſufficient for vs, as Chriſt ſayth
Matth. 6: <hi>I ſay vnto you, be not carefull for your life, what ye shall
eate, or what ye shall drinke: nor yet for your bodie, what ye shall put on. Is
not the life more worth then meate? and the bodie then rayment? Behold the
foules of the ayre: for they ſow not, neither reape, nor carie into the
barnes: yet your heauenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better then
they? Which of you by taking care, is able to adde one cubit vnto his
ſtature? And why care ye for rayment? Learne how the lillies of the field do
grow: they are not weried, neither ſpinne: yet I ſay vnto you, that even
Salomon in all his glorie, was not arayed like one of theſe. VVherefore if
God ſo clothe the graſſe of the field, which though it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to day, is
to morow caſt into the ouen, shall he not do much more vnto you, O ye of
litle faith? Therefore take no thought, ſaying what shall we eat? or what
shall we drinke? or wherewith shall we be clothed? (For after all theſe
thinges ſeeke the Gentiles:) For your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father knoweth that ye haue
neede of all theſe thinges. <pb n="366" facs="tcp:9413:192"/> But ſeeke ye firſt the
kingdome of God and his righteouſnes, and all theſe thinges shalbe
miniſtred vnto you. Care not then for the morow: for the morow shall care for
it ſelfe: the daye hath enough with his owne griefe.</hi> Ye ſee in this
place, how God hath a care for the foules and flowers, &amp; doth adorne them
after a moſt goodly ſort: how much more will God giue vnto vs thoſe
thinges that be neceſſarie? and yet we can not put our truſt in him,<note place="margin">Where truſt in God is not there chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ceaſſeth.</note>
ſo hath the Deuell entangled vs in his ſnares. When one commeth ſo farre,
that he is not content with that he hath, neither truſteth in God, then
charitie muſt needes ſodenly ceaſſe, ſo that he doth good to no man,
but onely prouideth that his owne heape be encreaſed. Hereupon came the
ſpirituall ſtate of ſacrificing Prieſts and Monkes, that they might
onely helpe themſelues, feede their belly, auoide labour, enter into
Monaſteries, that thereof did riſe a true prouerbe: Deſperation maketh a
Monke, yea not only a Monk, but ſacrificing Prieſts, Biſhops &amp; Popes:
for they truſt not in God, that he is able to feede them, but they ſtudie
vpon this onely, that they may be deliuered from all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and infirmitie,
which is altogether to liue in incredulitie: they neuer truſted in God, that
he is able to giue them nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and thinges neceſſarie, if any of
them ſhould mary a wife and remaine without that ſtate of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, here is an example ſet forth vnto vs, which prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
and allureth vs to confidence, and firſt that we commit our bellie to God:
for he hath a care of vs, euen in temporall things. Which ſufficiently
appeareth in Peter, whereas he tooke ſuch a great multitude of fiſhes,
which ranne by great companies into his nettes. Whereby is plainly ſignified
that God will forſake no man, but that euerie one ſhall haue enough, if
that we ſhall onely truſt in him, as the 37. Pſal. affirmeth: <hi>I haue
bin yong, and now am olde, and yet ſaw I neuer the righteous forſaken, nor
his ſeede begging bread.</hi> Things neceſſarie ſhal not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vnto vs, if faith be not wanting: for before we ſhould want, the very Angels
ſhould come, &amp; miniſter vnto vs foode. Whereas therefore men are
commonly oppreſſed with ſo great miſerie, onely vnbeliefe is the
cauſe thereof.<note place="margin">VVe muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp; not be carefull,
but commit the ſucceſſe vnto God.</note> And albeit God be with vs,
notwithſtanding he requireth yet of vs, worke or labour, and hope, if he at
any time differre ſomewhat to helpe vs. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth Peter here, that for
the taking of fiſhes, he ſhould caſt <pb n="367" facs="tcp:9413:192"/> forth his
nettes: <hi>Lanche out into the deepe,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>and let dovvne your
nets to make a draught,</hi> as if the Lord ſaid: Do thou that which
belongeth to a fiſher caſt thy net into the deepe, and commit the
ſucceſſe vnto me, leaue the care vnto me. God leaueth not the care vnto
thee, but the worke and labour: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we after a cleane contrarie order,
ſtudy to commit the care to our ſelues and the labour to him. Whereby it
commeth to paſſe, that euerie one for himſelfe applieth his mynde
earneſtly to gaine, and to gather money vnto himſelfe, that he may not be
enforced by any meanes to take paines and labour. But if thou wilt liue a
Chriſtian life, leaue vnto thy God to care howe the fiſhes ſhall come
into the nets, and goe thou, and take vpon thee the ſtate wherein thou
mayſt labour. Howbeit for the moſt part, we wiſh ſuch ſtates of life,
as in which there is no neede of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which is altogether a deueliſh
thing. And therefore haue we bin conſecrated Monkes and ſacrificing
Prieſts, that we might liue onely like gentlemen, without labour. And for the
ſame cauſe parents haue ſet their children to ſchole, that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
laſt they might liue merie dayes, and ſo ſerue God, as they thought.
Whereby it came to that paſſe that they did not know, what a good life was:
foraſmuch as God eſpecially commendeth that, and that in deed is acceptable
vnto him, which is gotten with the ſweat of the browes, as he commaunded
Adam. Gen. 3. <hi>In the ſvveat of thy face shalt thou eate breade.</hi> And
the deeper thou art occupied in this lawe, in ſo much better caſe thy
thinges are, wherefore follow thy worke, labour, and truſt in God, all
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes being caſt of.</p>
            <p>Now ſome murmur, and ſay, if faith be preached, that we muſt
truſt in God, and leaue the care vnto him, I might long enough, ſay they,
beleeue or truſt, before I ſhould haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to be fed and
ſuſteined, if I ſhould not labour. Yea it is plaine enough that thou
muſt labour,<note place="margin">We muſt ſtill labour and hope, though God
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his help for a time, for he will at the laſt aſſuredly helpe
vs.</note> foraſmuch as labour is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded thee: Howbeit ſuffer God to
care for thee, beleeue thou, and labour, then ſhalt thou aſſuredly haue
thoſe thinges that be neceſſarie for the ſuſtentation of thy life.
And this is an other thing, that we muſt hope notwithſtanding, though God
differreth for a time. Therefore he ſuffreth them to labour all the night,
and to take nothing, and ſheweth himſelfe to be ſuch a one, as will
ſuffer them to periſh with hunger. Which might haue <pb n="368" facs="tcp:9413:193"/>
come into the minde of Peter, when he had fiſhed ſo long and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
nothing, ſo that he might haue ſaid: now God will ſuffer my belly to
periſh with pining and famine. Howbeit he doth not ſo, but goeth on ſtill
in his labour, he plieth his worke, &amp; hopeth that God at the laſt will
giue him fiſhes, albeit he differreth a time. God therefore is preſent, and
giueth him ſo many fiſhes in one day, as he could ſcarce take in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſpace of eight daies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe thinges are to be learned well of
thee, that thou labour and hope, although God differreth his bleſſing a
litle. For albeit he differreth a while, and ſuffreth thee to labour ſore,
ſo that thou now thinke thy labour to be loſt, yet muſt thou not
therefore deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peire, but repoſe thy hope in him, truſting aſſuredly
that he will at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt giue thee proſperous ſucceſſe. For he wil
certainly come &amp; giue more then thou didſt neede, as he did here vnto S.
Peter. Wherefore if God delayeth with thee a litle, thinke with thy ſelfe, he
delayed alſo with S. Peter, &amp; yet afterward gaue vnto him aboundantly.
Commit thy matter therefore to his good will and pleaſure, and leaue not of
thy worke, but hope ſtill, and then ſhall not thy hope be fruſtrate. Thus
much concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the text, now let vs here the latter. After
therefore that they had taken fiſhes, and taſted the frute of faith, their
faith is increaſed and augmented. We therefore muſt go ſo farre, that we
may commit our bellie to God: for he that can not commit ſo much as his
bellie to him, will neuer commit his ſoule vnto him. Howbeit that is onely a
childiſh faith: Here we learne firſt to go by benches and ſettles: here
we do feede on milke as yet: but we muſt likewiſe learne by theſe to
commit our ſoule alſo to God. The Euangeliſt ſo meaneth when he
ſayth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now when Simon Peter ſaw it, he fell downe at Ieſus knees,
ſaying: Lord goe from me, for I am a ſinnefull man. For he was vtterly
aſtonied, and all that vvere with him, for the draught of fishes vvhich they
tooke.</hi> Let Peter here be a type or figure of them which beleeue eternal
good thinges, and counte him as one verily looking for &amp; ſeeing the good
things to come. A ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is of that nature,<note place="margin">The nature of a ſynnefull conſcience.</note> that it ſo
behaueth it ſelfe, as Peter here did, whereas he flieth his Sauiour, and
thinketh: Lord I am more vnworthy, then that I ſhould be ſaued, and ſit
among thy Sainctes and Angels: for that good is moſt exceeding high. Here a
ſtraight conſcience is not able to comprehend ſuch great 
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:9413:193"/> good thinges, but it thus thinketh: If I were as Peter
&amp; Paul, I could eaſily beleeue: Which is altogether a fooliſh and vaine
thinge. For if thou wouldeſt place thy ſelfe according to thine owne
holines, thou ſhouldeſt build vpon the ſande. Thou muſt not do ſo,
but behaue thy ſelfe like vnto Peter, for in that he eſteemed himſelfe
vile, and iudged himſelfe vnworthy of ſo great grace, he rightly became
worthy. And therefore,<note place="margin">Though we feele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our
ſinnes we muſt not deſpeire, but truſt in God that he will remit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; receiue vs vnto grace.</note> whereas thou art a ſynner, thou muſt
truſt in God, and dilate and open wide thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and heart, that
grace may enter in. After thou haſt now knowne God, thou muſt reiect none
of his giftes, that is, when as thou ſeeſt the great good things, thou
muſt not deſpeire. It is good that we know our ſelues, &amp; the deeper
we know our ſelues, ſo much the better. But that grace is not to be
refuſed becauſe of thy ſynnes. For when thou ſhalt fynde thy
conſcience to tremble, ſo that it would driue away ſynnes, then art thou
moſt ready and moſt fitte to receiue grace, then ſhalt thou fynde comfort
in thy conſcience and ſay with Micheas: <hi>VVho is ſuch a God as
thou,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that pardoneſt wickednes,
&amp; caſteſt all our ſynnes into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the ſea?</hi>
Whoſoeuer take not away ſynnes, they are no Gods, but idols: whereupon he
ſayeth rightly, that none is like vnto our God. For other gods will fynde and
not bring godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but the Almightie God doth not finde it, but bring it:
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt not forthwith deſpeire, if thy conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce trembleth
and feeleth ſynne. For the more defiled that thou art, ſo much the ſooner
doeth the Lord poure in his grace, if ſo be thou be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant and
thirſteſt after it. A great part goe ſo farre that they ſaye they merit
grace, whiles they diſpoſe them ſelues thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which is, as they
interpret, whiles they do that which lyeth in them, and alſo that they doe
ſatiſfie for their ſynnes. But it is not ſo. The Scripture teacheth vs
that it is God that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſynne, and caſteth it into the bottome of
the ſea. We ſhall not put away ſynnes by our workes, neither ſhall we
be iuſtified of our ſelues. God himſelfe, and none but he ſhall do the
thinge, of his meere grace as Eſay ſayth: <hi>I am, euen I am he
onely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 43.25.</note> 
               <hi>that for myne owne
ſelfes ſake doe take awaye thine offences, and forget thy ſynnes, ſo
that I will neuer thinke vpon them more.</hi> And ſo muſt thou beleeue,
otherwiſe thou ſhalt neuer obtaine a ioyfull conſcience. Wherefore, when
as Peter ſayd, <hi>I am a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> he ſaide right. It is true in
deede, there were cauſes, why <pb n="370" facs="tcp:9413:194"/> he might be afrayde of
himſelfe, and humble himſelfe, but he ought not to refuſe God, but moſt
willingly receiue him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou ſhalt feele thy ſynne, like as
Peter did, and ſhalt perceiue that thou wouldeſt now flie from God, then is
it neede that thou do forthwith turne thy ſelfe, and come more and more vnto
him. For if God ſhould goe away, and would not take away thy ſynne, would
not come vnto thee, nor ſeeke thee, yet the more thou perceiueſt thy
ſelfe a ſynner, the more haſt thou oughteſt to make vnto him, which
ſee thou marke well, and lay it vp in a myndefull memorie. For as Sainct
Peter doeth here, ſo all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences do, which are terrified of ſynnes,
and would flie from God, &amp; ſeeke an other god, do not thou leaue ſo,
but come boldly, and ioyne thy ſelfe neerer vnto God. Otherwiſe if one goe
away to ſeeke workes, and helpe of an other god, he is then found like the
fooliſh Virgines, which while they goe to get themſelues oyle, are in the
meane ſeaſon ſhut out. But what doeth Chriſt, when Peter ſo humbleth
himſelfe? and by reaſon of his great feare and terrour, deſireth the Lord
to depart from him? did he leaue him in ſuch deſperation of himſelfe? No
truly, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth him, ſaying thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feare not, from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce forth thou shalt catch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> This is
a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full word,<note place="margin">God ſuſtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both in
body &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> whereby weake heartes receiue comfort. Now
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God hath a care for vs, yea euen in thoſe thinges that
pertaine to the body, ye ſee by this, that he giueth Peter ſo many
fiſhes: he maketh him alſo ſo full and rich in ſpirit, that he ought to
beſtow ſome of his plenty vpon others. He maketh him a fiſher both in
body and in ſpirit: in body, for that he taketh many fiſhes which he may
ſell: but in ſpirit he is a fiſher of men. For he hath the Goſpel,
whereby other men muſt be brought to God by him, and the kingdome of Chriſt
be increaſed. Loe, it commeth to paſſe, that where men beleeue, the Lord
giueth ſo much, as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coureth and helpeth all men. The faithfull man
outwardly hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the needy with his ſubſtaunce and goods: And from within
he breaketh forth, teacheth other, and enricheth them alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. For
ſuch a man can not hold his peace, but is enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſhew and declare to
others, how he is delt with, as it is in the 51. Pſal. <hi>Make me a cleane
heart, O God, and renue a right ſpirit within me. Caſt me not away from thy
preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me. O giue me the comfort of thy
helpe <pb n="371" facs="tcp:9413:194"/> againe, and ſtablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy wayes vnto the wicked, and ſynners shalbe conuerted
vnto thee.</hi> And in an other Pſalme alſo Dauid ſayeth: <hi>I
beleeued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.10.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore will
I ſpeake.</hi> Which is thus much in effect: when I beleeue, I knowe God, and
taſt of his goodnes, then I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the caſe of other men, and go and
declare ſuch knowledge and goodnes of God vnto them. We ſee therefore in
this text, howe carefull God is for them that be his, and that he doth
ſuſteine them both in body and in ſpirit. But if he doth ſometime
differre any thinge, without all doute it is through the fault of our
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie, or becauſe we haue now new begon to beleeue. For where faith
is new and litle, there is ſometime ſmall and ſclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der helpe, that we
may learne to know the Lord, and to truſt in him. But when we haue gone ſo
farre that we truſt ſtrongly in God, then nothing can be wanting to vs,
then God poureth vpon vs both corporall and ſpirituall good thinges, and ſo
aboundant treaſures that we may be able to helpe others. This in deede is to
enrich the poore and to fill the hungrie. Thus much ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fize
concerning this text.</p>

looked for in the Goſpell, and what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto vs therein, namely
the true nature and qualitie of fayth. And this is the cauſe why Chriſt is
of all the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes ſet forth to be ſo louing and gentle: for
although the doings and workes deſcribed of them doe oftentimes varie,
neuertheles the ſimplicitie of fayth remayneth alwayes alike. Moreouer 
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:9413:195"/> this text doeth ſo liuely ſet forth Chriſt vnto vs
in his colours, that it may be manifeſt and well knowen vnto euerie one of
vs, what we ought to promiſe our ſelues concerning him, to wit, that he is
mercifull, bountifull, gentle, who ſuccoureth all that flie vnto him for
helpe. And ſuch ought to be the image of fayth.<note place="margin">By the Lawe
we are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and caſt downe, but by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell we are comforted

one of feare, which repreſenteth to our eyes the horrible wrath of God,
before which no man is able to ſtand, but rather we are all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to be
caſt downe in minde, when we ſee it, vnles we be ſtrengthned by fayth.
Howbeit againſt this is ſette the other image namely of grace, which fayth
doeth attentiuely behold, and taketh from hence principles of comfort, and
conceiueth truſt and confidence in the fauour of God, hauing this hope, that
man can not promiſe to him ſelfe from God ſo manye good thinges, but that
he hath infinite moe treaſures in a readines for him.</p>
            <p>Ye haue now ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times heard,<note place="margin">The tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and
out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God ought to be as meanes to make vs hope and
truſt in him, that he will alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs ſpirituall and eternal
good thinges.</note> that there are two ſorts of good thinges, ſpirituall
and corporall. The Goſpell by theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and corporall good thinges
teacheth vs the faith of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they are vnto the weake as a certaine
meane or helpe, whereby they may learne the goodnes of God, how bountifull he
is in beſtowing his riches vpon vs, and that we ought in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
thinges alſo to place all our hope and truſt in him. For if we be now
inſtructed by the Goſpell, that God will giue foode to our bellie, we may
thereupon account with our ſelues, that he will nouriſh &amp; cloath our
ſoules with ſpirituall good thinges. If I can not commit my body vnto him
that he may feede it, much leſſe can I commit my ſoule vnto him that he
may alwayes preſerue it. Or if I can not be brought to beleeue, that a crowne
of golde ſhalbe giuen vnto me of him, how I pray you, ſhall I hope for
tenne of crownes of golde of him? from whom I dare not promiſe to my ſelfe
ſo much as a peece of bread, truly much leſſe ſhall I be perſwaded to
beleeue, that he will giue a fearme vnto me, or his whole inheritaunce. Now he
that is not able to atteine vnto this tender, and as it were as yet ſucking
faith, to him ſurely it is verie hard to beleeue, that God will pardon his
ſynnes, or preſerue his ſoule for euer. Foraſmuch as we are
perſwaded, that the ſoule is by infinite degrees to be preferred before the
bellie, toward which notwithſtanding he is touched <pb n="374" facs="tcp:9413:196"/>
with compaſſion as this our preſent text teacheth. Wherefore Saint Peter
hath righly admoniſhed:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Beloued
brethren, as new borne babes deſire that ſincere milke of the word, that ye
may grovv thereby.</hi> For it is not enough that the infant being put to the
teate doe ſucke, but he muſt alſo wax greater, and gather ſtrength,
that he may accuſtome himſelfe to feede on breade, and ſtronger meate.
Now to eate milke is to taſt of the fauour and grace of God, which is then
taſted of, when a triall thereof is had in our life. For although I ſhould
preach an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares of the bountifulnes, fauour, liberalitie and
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God toward vs, it would profit me nothing vnleſſe I haue a
triall and taſte of thoſe commodities, neither could I learne rightly to
truſt in God thereby. Hereof alſo thou mayſt coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture how rare a
Chriſtian man is. There are many which ſay, that they commit their bellie
to God, but that ſticketh onely in the tounge and lippes, when as rather it
ought to perce to the heart.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe conſider an example teaching vs the qualitie and
nature of faith.<note place="margin">The qualitie and nature of faith.</note> The
Apoſtle Heb. 11. hath written thus: <hi>Faith is the ground of thinges, which
are hoped for, and the euidence of thinges which are not ſeene,</hi> which is
thus much in effect: faith is the foundation, whereby I looke for that good
thinge, which is neither ſeene with the eyes, nor heard with the eares, but
which I muſt onely hope for. Euen as in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent text it plainly
appeareth, wherein we reade that there were about foure thouſand men, who
togither with their wiues and children had now ſuffred hunger three dayes
(was not this a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kynde of faſting?) yet were not famiſhed with
hunger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre from their houſes, and deſtitute of thoſe
neceſſaries, whereby the bodie is ſuſteined. Now Paule ſayth that
faith is a thinge whereby a man hopeth for thoſe thinges which appeare not to
the eyes. Such a fayth had this multitude, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſee no meate,
neuertheles they truſt in God, that he will feede them. What doeth Chriſt
here? he is moued with compaſſion, he demaundeth of the diſciples with
what vittailes, or with what thinge their hunger may be taken away. To whom his
diſciples aunſwere: whence can a man ſatiſfie ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude here
in the wildernes? Here ye ſee how mans reaſon and fayth agree togither,
that the wiſer reaſon is, ſo much leſſe can <pb n="375" facs="tcp:9413:196"/> it
ſubmit it ſelfe to the workes of God. For this cauſe therefore did he
aſke his diſciples, that euerie one of them might trie their owne reaſon,
and learne how much the capacitie of man and faith do differ one from an
other.</p>
            <p>Here it appeareth vnto vs how reaſon is blynde, and how,<note place="margin">Reaſon muſt giue place to faith.</note> when faith commeth, it
ought to giue place. Whereof let this be as an example: If I were a maried man,
hauing a wife and a companie of children, and had nothing wherewith to
nouriſh them, neither would any man giue me any thinge: yet ſhould it be my
dutie to beleeue and hope, that God will prouide for me. But when as I ſee my
hope to be in vaine, and that I am not ſuccoured by and by with nouriſhment
and cloathing, then if I be faithles, I yeeld vnto deſperation, and goe and
purpoſe an other thinge with my ſelfe, I applie my mynde to vnhoneſt
trades, that I may get ſomewhat thereby, as theft, deceit, and other ſuch
practizes, and by all meanes that I am able, I paſſe through the ſtormes
of aduerſitie. See what filthie increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bringeth vnto man. But if I be
endued with faith, I ſhut mine eyes and ſay: Moſt gentle father, I am thy
creature, and thy worke, it can not be denied but thou haſt created me, I
will put all my truſt in thee, which haſt greater care of my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare then
I my ſelfe. Thou wilt well nouriſh, feede, cloath, and helpe, where and
when thou ſhalt know beſt. So faith is a ſure foundation, whereunto I
truſting,<note place="margin">No maner of thing that is good shalbe wanting to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull.</note> doe looke for thoſe thinges which I ſee not, and that
I may ſpeake at once, it ſhall not want thoſe thinges that be
neceſſarie. Surely the Angels themſelues ſhould come downe from heauen,
&amp; giue bread digged euen out of the earth, vnto ſuch a faithfull man,
that he might be nouriſhed, rather then he ſhould be pined with hunger, yea
heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, before God will ſuffer a man endued with
ſuch faith to want either clothing or any other neceſſarie thinge. This
ſingular truſt and confidence in God, the comfortable and effectuall worde
of the diuine promiſe doeth require. Whereof Dauid glorieth Pſal. 37: <hi>I
haue been young and nowe am olde, and yet ſawe I neuer the righteous
forſaken, nor his ſeede begging bread.</hi> And againe: <hi>God knoweth the
dayes of the righteous, their inheritaunce shall continue for euer. They shall
not be confounded in the perilous time, and in the dayes of dearth they shall
haue enough.</hi> But if we ſhall aſke counſell <pb n="376" facs="tcp:9413:197"/> of
reaſon, it will forthwith ſay (as the diſciples did before) this thinge
is vnpoſſible: for it looketh for nothing, it truſteth to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when
nothing is preſent. Of like diffidence were the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who thought
thus with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: how can it be that ſuch a great multitude of men
ſhould be here refreſhed with meate? truly it exceedeth our capacitie. If
they had ſeene an heape of money, ſtore of breade, and ſhambles full of
fleſh, they could then haue eaſily relieued this preſent neceſſitie,
they could haue put all in a good hope, and fitly haue diſpoſed all
thinges, according to the capacitie of their reaſon.</p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffize to be ſpoken concerning the
faith of temporall good things: now we will entreat of ſpirituall good
thinges, which ſhall come vnto vs when we ſhall die. Then ſhall we ſee
death ſet before our eyes, when as notwithſtanding we would willingly liue,
then ſhall hell appeare vnto vs, when we rather deſire for heauen, then
ſhall we behold the iudgement of God, notwithſtanding his grace would be
much more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto vs. In a ſumme, whatſoeuer we would deſire to
ſee, ſhalbe taken out of our ſight, yea and no creature ſhall helpe vs
againſt death,<note place="margin">Faith ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to truſte in God
euen in greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie and diſtreſſe.</note> hell, and the
iudgement of God. But if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, I ſaye thus vnto my ſelfe: well, faith
is a ſure foundation: herewith I being ſtayed vp, ſhall attaine vnto
thoſe thinges which are verie farre out of my ſight, albeit thoſe thinges
be horrible which be in my ſight, yet ſhall they not hurt him that
beleeueth. Although therefore I doe preſently ſee nothinge, but death,
hell, and the iudgement of God, yet muſt I conſider none of theſe, but
rather my mynde is to be confirmed with an vndouted truſt, that God by the
vertue of his promiſe, not in reſpect of my merites or workes, will giue
vnto me life, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes, and grace. This in deede is to cleaue vnto God
by ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere fayth, which is here verie well painted forth in this groſſe
and bodily image of foure thouſand men, who cleauing to God onely by faith,
did not doute that they ſhould be refreſhed of him. If they had iudged
according to the capacitie of their reaſon, they would haue murmured, and
ſaid after this ſort: ſurely we are a verie great multitude, we are here
in the wide wildernes, we haue emptie and hungrie ſtomackes, here is nothing
that is able to fill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit they murmured of none of theſe things, but
conceiuing a ſure confidence, reaſoning nothing againſt God 
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:9413:197"/> after the affection of men, they commende them ſelues
wholy to the good will of God, and commit vnto him this vrging neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of hunger, they them ſelues being quiet from all care. Then God, before this
care commeth vpon them, and before they begin to aſke of him, is preſent,
being more carefull for them, then they are for them ſelues, &amp; ſayth on
this ſort: <hi>I am moued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward the multitude: if I
ſend them away faſting, it is a daunger leſt they faint by the way.</hi>
Behold how gentle &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull we haue God toward vs, who hath euen a care
to feede the vncleane belly. Here now our hope is erected, and the wordes of
Chriſt are comfortable to a man, when he ſayth: They haue now continued
with me three dayes, it now behoueth me to giue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vnto them to
eate. Here we may ſee, that all that doe ſticke diligently to the word of
God, are fed of God him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let vs dearly beloued, at the laſt begin to
beleeue,<note place="margin">Incredulitie the mother of ſinne.</note> for onely
diffidence and incredulitie is the mother of all ſinnes &amp; vices, which at
this day reigne in all ſorts of men. How commeth it to paſſe, that euery
where, whetherſoeuer we turne vs, there are ſo many harlots and baudes,
ſuch plenty of deluders and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, ſo many theeues, pillers,
vſerers, robbers, Simoniſts, as they call them, and ſellers of benefices?
All theſe diffidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God bringeth forth vnto vs. For ſuch kind of
men do iudge onely according to humane reaſon, and reaſon looketh vnto that
which is preſent: but that which it ſeeth not, it is not able to
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: wherefore while it doth not repoſe her truſt by faith in God,
it is enforced to deſpeire, which deſperation afterward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch
naughtie and wicked men. Behold thus it goeth out of frame with vs, when we
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit our ſelues to be ruled, not to faith, but to our owne reaſon.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, as ye haue now learned faith, ſo muſt ye alſo
learne loue. For Chriſt is ſette forth vnto vs in a double forme, in one,
of faith, that we ſhould not be ouer carefull: in an other, of loue,<note place="margin">Chriſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of loue.</note> that we may learne, that as
he hath care of vs, giuing vs meate, drink, apparel, &amp; that of meere &amp;
bountiful loue, not for his owne commodities ſake, or becauſe of our
merits: ſo alſo we ought to doe well to our neighbour, and that freely,
onely loue mouing vs thereunto, that as Chriſt is to vs, ſo we may be to
our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Hereupon now we may perceiue, that all works of Monks and
Nunnes are vaine and to be vtterly diſallowed, when they 
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:9413:198"/> are not directed to that end, that they may ſerue
their neighbour, but are ordeined onely vnto this ende, that they may merit
much at Gods handes by them. For the true workes of Chriſtians, which they
deſire to be accepted of God, muſt be done ſo, that they tend to the
profit of our neighbour, and not to this ende, that we ſhoulde thinke that we
ſhall merit many thinges of God by them, they muſt be cheerefully and
freely beſtowed vpon all, euen as Chriſt hath done, who hath ſpred abroad
and freely beſtowed his goodnes vpon all. Theſe thinges haue I briefly
ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this text, that ye may thereby learne, that God requireth
this eſpecially of vs, that we doe firmely and conſtantly truſt in him,
and that we freely doe good and be beneficiall to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, according as
God hath of his meere goodnes and mercie beſtowed infinite benefits and
bleſſings vpon vs. The Prophet ſayth Pſal. 50: <hi>Heare O my people
and I will ſpeake, I my ſelf will teſtifie vnto thee O Iſraell, I am
the Lord, euen thy Lorde. I will not reproue thee, becauſe of thy
ſacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings, for that they be not alway before me.
I will take no bullocke out of thy houſe, nor goates out of thy foldes. for
all the beaſtes of the foreſt are mine, and ſo are the cattell vpon a
thouſand hills. I know all the foules vpon the mountaines: and the wild
beaſtes of the field are at my commaundement. If I be hungrie, I will not
tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is therein. Thinkeſt
thou that I will eate bulls flesh, and drinke the blood of Goates?</hi> After
the ſame ſort he ſayth vnto vs: Behold Iſraell, that is, thou faithfull
man, I am thy God, thou art not my God, I will giue vnto thee, thou giueſt
nothing to me, I will not be angrie with thee, for that thou offereſt not
many things vnto me. For whatſoeuer is in thy ſtable, in thy hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in
thy court, it was all mine before, for I haue ſent it thither. Whereby he
briefly reproued the Iewes, who did meruelouſly pleaſe them ſelues in
their ſacrifices. Now becauſe he reiecteth theſe ſacrifices, what will
he haue to ſupply the place of them? truely euen that which followeth in the
ſame place: <hi>Offer vnto me praiſe, and thy vowes, call vpon me in the
time of trouble, &amp; I vvil heare thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> That
is, I wil haue thine hart, giue ouer thy ſelf to me, &amp; account me for a
gentle, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable, yea and for thy God, and it ſhall ſuffize me.
Wherefore place thy faith, truſt and hope in him, count him for a gentle and 
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:9413:198"/> louing God, cleaue vnto him, and in extreme anguiſh
flie vnto him for ſuccour, and to none beſide him. Beleeue and looke for
helpe of him, then he will helpe thee, thou needeſt not any whit dout.
Afterward doe good to thy neighbour with a cheereful hart and freely. Theſe
two things are ſet forth in this our text, as alſo in many other places
beſide.</p>

the frute and commoditie thereof, alſo what Diſciples it hath, of which
nothing is here done, or ſayd: but the puniſhment and miſerie onely is
ſhewed, which was to come vpon the Iewes, for that they knew not the time of
their viſitation. Which thing let vs well conſider of, for it pertaineth
vnto vs alſo. If they be puniſhed which know not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of their
viſitation, what ſhal come vnto them, which perſecute, blaſpheme and

them which know not the ſeaſon of their viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Two wayes to preach againſt the contemners of Gods word.</note>
The contemners of God are preached againſt after two ſortes: firſt by
threatnings, as Chriſt threatneth them Matth. 11: <hi>VVo be to thee,
Corazin: VVo be to thee Bethſaida: for if the great works which vvere done in
you, had bene done in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in
ſackecloth and ashes. But I ſay to you, it shall be eaſier for Tyrus and
Sydon at the day of iudgement, then for you. And thou, Capernaum</hi> (which
was his owne citie, wherein chiefly he wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) <hi>vvhich att lifted
vp vnto heauen, shalt be brought dovvne to hell: for if the great vvorkes
vvhich haue bene done in thee, <pb n="381" facs="tcp:9413:199"/> had bene done among them
of Sodom, they had remained to this day. But I ſay vnto you, that it shall be
eaſier for them of the land of Sodom in the day of iudgement, then for
you.</hi> Theſe are the threatnings wherewith he terrifieth them, that they
ſhoulde not ſo neglect the word of God. The other way the Lorde here
ſheweth, when as he ſhedeth teares, and is touched with pitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
miſerable and blind men, he doth not terrifie or threaten them, as being
indurate and obſtinat, but is rather wholy moued with loue and taketh pitie
on his enemies, and would willingly call them backe, but that he could preuaile
nothing with them, &amp; the meanes which he vſed to reclaime them were in
vaine. Before in Matthew, whereas he ſharply rebuketh them, he dealeth not by
loue, but by rigour, but here is pure loue and pitie, as we ſhall afterwards
ſee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when he drew neare to the citie, ſome went before him,
and ſome followed him, with great ioy ſinging and ſaying: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna
the ſonne of Dauid,</hi> they ſpred their garments in the way, they cut
downe branches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the way, and all thinges
were done after a goodly maner, but in the middeſt of this ioy Chriſt
beginneth greatly to weepe,<note place="margin">Chriſt lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for
Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</note> he ſuffreth all to reioyce, notwithſtanding his eyes
guſhed out with teares, when he beheld the citie, and ſayd: <hi>If thou
haddeſt euen knowne at the leaſt in this thy day thoſe things vvhich
belonge vnto thy peace, thou vvouldeſt take heede: but novve are they hid
from thine eyes.</hi> As if the Lorde ſhould ſay: O, if thou kneweſt what
belongeth vnto thy peace that thou mighteſt not be deſtroyed, but ſtand
ſtill, thou wouldeſt yet at this day conſider of it and beware. Now it
were time for thee to know that which ſhould be beſt for thee, but thou art
blinde, &amp; wilt neglect the time, then ſhall there be no place neither for
helpe nor counſell. As if he ſayd: Thou ſtandeſt here adorned with
ſumptuous and goodly buildings, and there are in thee mighty citizens, which
are both ſecure and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, thinking that no daunger hangeth ouer them, but
after the ſpace of forty yeares thou ſhalt be deſtroyed. Which the Lorde
plainly foretelleth in theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall
caſt a trench about thee, and compaſſe thee round, and keepe thee in on

ſafe, reſting vpon the promiſe of God, ſo that they thought no
otherwiſe, but that they ſhould perſeuerantly continue ſo for euer,
they were ſecure and thought thus with them ſelues: God will not ſend
ſuch thinges vnto vs: we haue the temple, wherein God him ſelfe is
reſident. We haue alſo plenty of excellent men, money, and other thinges,
Goe to then, who can doe any hurt or harme to vs? Moreouer the Emperour and
people of Rome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken the citie, ſeeing it furniſhed with ſo many
and ſo great munitions and goodly and excellent buildings, merueiled
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and confeſſed, that it was vnpoſſible that ſo great a citie
ſhould be taken, vnleſſe it had bene the ſpeciall will of God. Their
boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting therefore, and confidence in their owne falſe opinion decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them. Howbeit the Lord did more earneſtly and deepely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the matter
then they, when he ſayd: O Ieruſalem, if thou kneweſt thoſe thinges
that are knowne to me, thou wouldeſt haue a care of thy peace (peace in the

make thee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the ground, deſtroy all thy buildings, and leaue not a
ſtone vpon a ſtone, thou wouldeſt ſurely conueniently receiue the word,
whereby thou mighteſt enioy both true peace, and all good thinges. The
reading of the hiſtorie of the deſtruction of this city doth make much to

diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note>God had plainly ſo ordained, that at the feaſt of
Eaſter, at which time they came to Ieruſalem out of all quarters, the citie
ſhould be beſieged, and there were then gathered togither, as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus
reporteth, about thirty hundred thouſand me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon whom the Lorde would
ſhewe his grieuous indignation and wrath. All the Apoſtles and Chriſtians
were departed and gone into the cuntrie of Herod, not farre from Ieruſalem.
The Lord tooke out the wheate, and put the chaffe togither on an heape, nowe
there was ſo great a multitude of people, that they might ſeeme to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
not onely a citie, but euen a kingdom. And they were driuen into ſo great
calamitie, that all their vittells were ſpent, and none <pb n="383" facs="tcp:9413:200"/> at al left vnto them, ſo that they were conſtrained to eate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſtrings of their bowes, &amp; olde ſhoes, dreſſing them in ſuch maner
as they could, yea through the exceeding famine, they were driuen to kil their
owne children: the ſouldiers tooke the fleſh of children ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from the
mothers, ſmelling the ſauour of the roſted fleſh two ſtreetes of:
pigeons dunge was vnto them in ſteede of ſalte, and was alſo very deare:
finally there was ſo great miſerie, ſo great ſlaughter and ſhedding
of blood, that it would not haue bene mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell for a ſtone to haue bene moued
with pitie. He that had ſeene it, would haue thought that God could not haue
bene ſo grieuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly angry, and ſo greatly haue afflicted a people. Both
houſes and ſtreets were filled with carkaſes dead through famine.
Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Iewes remained ſtil ſo obſtinate and without
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that they gloried of God, and would not yeelde them ſelues
vntil the Emperour ſet vpon them with his whole power, and tooke the citie,
which they were able to keepe no lenger. And when as ſome of them were ſo
craftie that they deuoured golde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might not be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them, the
Romane ſouldiers thought that they had all ſo done, whereupon they flewe
about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and hauing ript their bellies ſought for golde. There
was ſuch a ſlaughter &amp; manquelling made, that it ſeemed a miſerable
thing euen to the Gentiles, wherefore Ceſar commaunded that they ſhould not
be ſo ſlaine, but led captiue and ſould. The Iewes were then ſould ſo

that they ſhall neuer be able any more to erect their Prieſthood and
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they hope they ſhall.</p>
            <p>Thus God reuenged the death of Chriſt, &amp; all the Prophets,
thus were they recompenſed for that they knewe not the time of their
viſitation. Wherfore let vs be here admoniſhed,<note place="margin">The

all Germanie. It is no ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting matter or ſport, neither is there any
cauſe why we ſhould perſwade our ſelues that it will fall out
otherwiſe with vs. The Iewes would not beleeue that euill ſhould come vpon
them, vntil they had ſufficiently tried it. And we at this day are viſited
by the <pb n="384" facs="tcp:9413:201"/> benefite of God: he hath opened vnto vs a
treaſure, his ſacred and holy Goſpell, whereby we know his will, and
ſee how much we were ſubiect to the power of Satan: but no man wil receiue
this Goſpell, yea we contemne it, and that which is more miſerable, we
perſecute and blaſpheme it. God is patient: it pleaſeth him to trie vs a
while: if we be not watchfull, ſo that the word be againe taken from vs, the
ſame wrath and indignation which was pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth vpon the Iewes, ſhal
alſo be poured forth vpon vs. For there is the ſame Word, the ſame God,
the ſame Chriſt at this day, that there was at that time, whereupon
vndoubtedly the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhal be the ſame, or at the leaſt as
grieuous both in ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>We make almoſt a ſport &amp; trifling matter of the Goſpel.
For no man embraceth it from his hart, no man frameth his maners according vnto
it. Which is a manifeſt argument of blindnes. O thing ſurely moſt
miſerable. I feare leſt the matter will ſhortly come to that paſſe,
that all Germanie will fall togither vpon an heape, which (alas) in part of the
communaltie hath already had a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table beginning, we haue loſt a great
multitude of people, almoſt an hundred thouſand men haue bene ſlaine
onely betwene the feaſts of Eaſter and Whitſontide. It is a hard worke of
God, and I feare me the warre begon is not yet at an ende, this is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a
forewarning and threatning wherby God would terrifie vs, that we might
diligently take heede to our ſelues: it was nothing but the Foxes tayle, if
he come againe with his whippe, he will ſcourge vs more grieuouſly. But we
will behaue our ſelues as the Iewes behaued them ſelues, vntill there
ſhall be place for no ſuccour nor helpe. Now we might preuent it, now were
the time to knowe what ſhoulde be beſt for vs, and to receiue the Goſpell
with peace, for at this day grace is offered vnto vs, whereby we may liue
peaceably, but we ſuffer day to paſſe after day, yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeare,
applying our ſelues leſſe to the Goſpel then before. No man doth now
pray vnto God for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> increaſe of his word, no man receiueth it in his hart.
If ſo be that the time ſhall paſſe, no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhal any more helpe.
We wey not this matter in our hart, we thinke our ſelues ſafe, we do not
throughly perceiue the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie already come to paſſe, neither doe
we conſider in our minds, how miſerably God puniſheth vs with falſe
prophets and ſects, which he on euery ſide ſendeth vnto vs, which preach
ſo ſecurely, <pb n="385" facs="tcp:9413:201"/> as if they had wholy receiued into
their breaſt the ſpirit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter. Thoſe which we counted beſt of
all doe goe away, &amp; bring men into ſuch a perplexity, that they almoſt
know not either what is to be done or not to be done. But this is onely the
beginning, albeit ſufficient horrible and cruell. For there can not be
greater affliction and miſerie, then if the Lord ſend amongſt vs ſects
and falſe prophets, which are ſo raſh and bold, that it is greatly to be
lamented.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the time of grace is nowe preſent: Chriſt
hath bene ſent downe into the world, hath bene borne man, hath ſerued vs,
died for vs, is riſen againe from the dead, hath ſent vnto vs the ſpirit
the comforter, hath giuen vnto vs his word, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened heauen ſo wide, that
al good things may be obtained of vs, moreouer hath giuen vnto vs rich
promiſes, whereby he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he wil preſerue vs both in this
ſhort and fraile time, and in the eternal times, in this life, and in the
life to come, moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully pouring forth his grace vpon vs.<note place="margin">God will not ſuffer the contempt of his grace and word to be
vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> Wherefore the time of grace is now before our dores, but
we deſpiſe &amp; neglect it, which God neither will, neither can pardon.
For when as we contemne his word he threatneth puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and will at the
laſt puniſh vs, although he ſhould deferre it euen an hundred yeares, but
he will not deferre it ſo long. And the more purely that the word is
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, ſo much greater ſhal the puniſhment be. But I feare great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leſt this puniſhment require the ſubuerſion of all Germanie. God graunt
that in this thing I be a falſe prophet, but I feare exceedingly that it wil
come to paſſe. God can not leaue this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes vnreuenged, neither will
he deferre long, for the Goſpell is ſo aboundantly preached, that it was
not ſo manifeſt euen in the Apoſtles time as it is at this day, thankes
be to Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Wherefore I feare much leſt that all Germanie be
ſpoyled, yea and quite deſtroyed, vnleſſe we otherwiſe apply our
ſelues to this matter. We which haue long heard the Goſpell, ought to pray
God from the hart, that he would giue vs longer peace. The Princes goe about to
bring all thinges to paſſe by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword. whereby they goe too raſhly
and rigourouſly to worke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is exceeding needefull, that we
ſhould pray vnto God, that his Goſpell may ſpred farther abroad through
Germanie, euen vnto them which haue not yet heard it. For if puniſhment come
ſodainly vpon vs, our caſe ſhall be miſerable, then many ſoules 
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:9413:202"/> ſhall be in daunger to be loſt before the worde
ſhall come vnto them. I woulde wiſh therefore, that we woulde not ſo
cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Goſpell, that precious treaſure, not onely for our
owne ſake, but alſo for their ſakes which are as yet to heare it. A
ſcourge is a litle begon: God graunt that it may ſo ſtay, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

if that ciuill warre ſhoulde begin againe, it were to be feared that it would
haue none ende.</p>
            <p>We doe like as the Iewes did, who had a greater care of the belly
then of God, hauing more regard how to fill the belly, then that they might be
ſaued, wherefore they loſt both, and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely. For, foraſmuch as
they would not receiue life, God ſent vnto them death, ſo they loſt both
body and ſoule. They pretended the ſame cauſe that we do. We would
willingly in deede embrace the Goſpell, if there were no daunger of body and
goods, wife, &amp; children. If we ſhall beleeue him, ſayd the Iewes, the
Romanes wil come, and take away both our place and the nation, which
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles came vnto them, for that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked man feareth, falleth
vpon him. This was a lette and hinderance to the Iewes that they would not
beleeue the wordes of God, neither haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the rich and large
promiſes that he had made vnto them. So alſo doe we, we regard not the
mighty and comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which Chriſt hath made vnto vs, as where
he ſayth: <hi>He shall receiue an hundreth fold more,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and shal inherit euerlaſting
life.</hi> Leaue thy wife and children, I will preſerue them, I will
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them, ſo as thou goeſt to work boldly in my name. Thinkeſt
thou that I can not build thee other houſes? counteſt thou me ſo
ſimple, who will giue vnto thee heauen? wilt thou not put thy ſelf in
daunger for my ſake? if thy goods be taken from thee, it is wel with thee,
heauen and earth are mine, I will recompence thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly. Theſe and
ſuch like ſayings we paſſe ouer, yea and alſo contemne, hauing
diligent conſideration only what we haue layd vp in our cheſt, and that our
purſe may be full, neither doe we ſee, that euen that which we haue God
hath giuen vnto vs, &amp; will as yet giue vs more, if we beleeue and truſt
in him, neither doe we marke if that we loſe God, we ſhall loſe the belly
alſo.</p>

               <note place="margin">The faithful refuſe not to ſuffer perill
and trouble for God his ſake.</note>Howbeit they that beleeue in God, doe not
auoide perill if it come for his ſake, but commit all things to his diuine
power, that he may order them according to his will, and thus they thinke: 
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:9413:202"/> The Lord hath giuen me both a houſe and the furniture
thereof, wife, children, &amp;c. I haue not obtained them of my ſelf,
foraſmuch then as they are Gods, I will commit them vnto him, he ſhal
beſt preſerue them. For euen otherwiſe I muſt leaue them, wherfore I
will refuſe to ſuffer no perill, and to leaue whatſoeuer I haue for his
ſake, if the caſe ſo require. If he will haue me ſo to doe, he can giue
me other thinges, for he hath promiſed that he will giue ſufficient to them
that beleeue, both here and in the time to come. If he will not haue me to liue
here, I owe death vnto him, when he ſhall require me, I will be ready for his
wordes ſake. He that ſhall not doe thus, denieth God, and is
notwithſtanding compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to loſe both this fraile life, and eternall
life. The ſtinking bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which we make our god, is the cauſe,<note place="margin">Immoderate care for the belly the cauſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and
diſtruſt of Gods care &amp; prouidence.</note> that we doe not cleaue to
the word of God: for I will firſt be certaine howe I may feede my ſelfe,
and where my goods be. The Goſpell ſayth, Truſt in God, but I prouide for
my belly, and if I haue one noble in gold, I thinke I haue ſufficient to
ſuſtaine &amp; nouriſh me for ten daies, &amp; truſting vnto that which
I haue layd vp, I truſt not in God, that as he hath hitherto fedde me, ſo
he will nouriſh me ſtill. Is not this a deteſtable thinge, that I truſt
to one peece of coyne onely, whereby I looke to haue my foode and
ſuſtenance to morrow? Fy, what a curſed thing is ſuch care for the
belly? Shall a vile peece of coyne be more eſteemed of me, then God him
ſelfe, in whoſe power are heauen and earth, who giueth vnto vs ayer and
water, maketh graine to growe vnto vs, and ſendeth all thinges neceſſary?
It is more deteſtable then that it can be expreſſed by the voice of man,
that God is not eſteemed of vs ſo much as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle money. Why dooſt thou
not thinke: God who hath made me, will well nouriſh me, if he will haue me
liue. If he will not, well, then ſhall I haue no neede. But, ſayth the
belly, I finde no god in my cheſt. Thou fooliſh aſſe, who can
aſſure thee that thou ſhalt liue till tomorrow? It is vncertaine whether
thou ſhalt keepe thy belly till to morrow, and deſireſt thou to know
where foode and ſuſtenance is? If this did pearſe our hart, we ſhould
ſee how deuiliſh a thing incredulitie is. Is it not a horrible thing that I
doe not make ſo greate account of God, who feedeth ſo many mouthes, as to
truſt in him, that he will nouriſh me, yea that I do make more account of
one noble in golde then of God him ſelfe, who poureth forth his good things
ſo aboundantly? The world <pb n="388" facs="tcp:9413:203"/> is full of the bleſſings
and workes of God, he is on euery ſide with his good thinges,
notwithſtanding we doe not yet commit our ſelues to him, or receiue his
viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. O curſed world, which can not truſt to God euen one day, and
yet truſteth to a peece of gold. Thus we ſee, as I thinke, of what ſort
the world is, how it deſpiſeth God for the bellies ſake, which
notwithſtanding it is compelled to loſe. O how great contemners of
ſaluation are we? we ought rather to deteſt the world, but we are too
deepely drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in olde Adam. The world is as it were a figure of hell, yea a
very deuiliſh kingdom, &amp; an entrance to hell. Wherefore Chriſt with
weeping eyes exhorteth vs to knowe our ſaluation, and to receiue his
viſitation, leſt that a plague &amp; ſcourge follow, which vndoutedly
ſhall come vpon them, which thinking them ſelues in ſafetie, doe not
beleeue and truſt in God. God giue vs his grace, whereby we may knowe him. It

            <p>
               <hi>He went alſo into the temple, and beganne to caſt out them
that ſoulde therein, and them that bought, ſaying vnto them, it is written,
Mine houſe is the houſe of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of
theeues.</hi> This is the ſecond part of this text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is declared how
the Lord going into the temple, beginneth to driue out the byers and ſellers
therein. The former part was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an exhortation and inuiting to
faith, but here the Lorde inſinuateth what the temple of God is, and bringeth
a place out of the Scripture hereunto appertaining, namely out of Eſai,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſai.</hi> 56.7.</note> where he ſayth: <hi>Myne houſe
shall be called an houſe of prayer for all people.</hi> This is a ſtronge
ſaying, whereas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth, <hi>for all people,</hi> againſt the
Iewes, who truſting vnto that temple at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thought that this
houſe made with hand, ſhould continue for euer, ſuppoſing it to be
vnpoſſible, that God would either deſtroy this temple, or leaue the citie
deſolate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word of God can not lye. Wherefore they ſtoned
Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for that he ſpake againſt that holy citie, and affirmed that
Ieſus woulde deſtroy it, and chaunge the ceremonies giuen of Moſes. For
they ſayd: The Prophets haue greatly prayſed this houſe: and doe you
Apoſtles preache that it ſhall be deſtroyed? Howbeit this ſaying is
thus to be vnderſtood, that the citie Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, the Temple, and the
People ſhould continue vntill the time of Chriſt, whereunto all the
Prophets tend, which referred <pb n="389" facs="tcp:9413:203"/> all thinges vnto Chriſt,
that as he ſhould doe, ſo it ſhould be, and ſo it ſhould continue.
Wherefore the place of Eſai extendeth no farther then to the comming of
Chriſt, which all the Prophets alſo witnes, affirming that there ſhould
come a kingdom, which ſhould extend farre and wide ouer the whole worlde, as
it is in Malachie:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.</note> 
               <hi>From the
riſing of the ſunne vnto the going downe of the ſame, my name is great
among the Gentiles, and in euery place incenſe shall be offered to my name,
and a pure offering: for my name is great among the very Heathen, ſayth the
Lorde of hoſtes.</hi> Here the Prophet ſpeaketh of the ſpirituall kingdom
of Chriſt, who would builde vnto him ſelfe an houſe of prayer in the
whole world. It is true that God him ſelfe did confirme and ſanctifie the
temple at Ieruſalem, not becauſe it was furniſhed with precious ſtones
and goodly buildings, or halowed of the Prieſtes, which maner of trifles and
dotages we vſe at this day, but becauſe he had conſecrated and halowed it
with his worde, when he ſayd: This houſe is my houſe:<note place="margin">The true houſe of God.</note> for his word was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in it.
Whereſoeuer the worde of God is preached, there is his true houſe: where
the worde of God hath his courſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, there vndoutedly God
dwelleth with his grace: where his Goſpell is, there is the holy houſe of
prayer, there prayers both may and ought to be made vnto God. God alſo will
heare vs, as Chriſt ſayth Ioh. 16: <hi>VVhatſoeuer ye shall aske the
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name, he will giue it you: hitherto haue ye asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my
name: aske, &amp; ye shal receiue.</hi> Contrariwiſe, where the word is not,
there is Satan wholy. Now, whereas we imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Iewes haue builded ſo
many temples, it were tolerable, if we had therefore ſo done, that the word
of God might be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in them, for where Gods word is preached, there is he
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and poureth forth his grace.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſayth moreouer that the Iewes haue made the temple at
Ieruſalem a denne of theeues. But they were reſident in the temple which
ſould oxen and ſheepe, that they which came might buy to offer and
worſhip God: Why therefore doth he call it a de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of theeues? Surely he
giueth vnto it a foule name,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt calleth the temple
at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem a denne of theeues.</note> which came to paſſe vpon this
occaſion: for that it was not any more counted of them for the houſe of
God, but for a houſe of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, that is, the Prieſtes had no care how
the word of God was preached there, and did negligently and careleſly
ſinge, bable, and <pb n="390" facs="tcp:9413:204"/> reade Moſes and the Prophets. But
God doth nothing eſteeme that mumbling vp of many words, which is onely vaine
and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh. They behaued them ſelues like as our ſacrificing
Prieſtes and Munkes doe, who of temples &amp; Monaſteries making denns of
theeues, preach poyſonfull doctrine, and therefore onely they celebrate
Maſſe, that they may thereby get vnto them ſelues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and fill the
belly, killing &amp; deſtroying ſilly ſheepe with their traditions. Which
is the denne, wherein ſoules are ſlayne, which title is to be giuen to al
temples, wherein the word of God is not preached. For there they mocke God,
kill ſoules, expell the true word, and ſet vp theeuerie. O how fowly haue
we bene deceiued in this point? But God at this day is highly to be prayſed,
that his word renueth &amp; quickneth vs, driueth away theeues, &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs to pray aright. For a ſincere Chriſtian muſt pray not in mouth onely,
but in hart alſo. Thus we haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond part of our text, how Chriſt
caſteth out the ſellers, that is them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſerued the belly, and maketh
place for his worde. It were very good if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries were ſcoured after
this ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either Chriſtian ſcholes, or places wherein the word of
God might be preached, might be made of them: which if it come not to
paſſe, they are, and doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine dennes of theeues. If Chriſt calleth
his houſe a denne of theeues, how much more ſhall our temples, which God
hath not conſecrated, be proued to be dennes of theeues?</p>
            <p>I haue often times deſired you, that ye would deuoutly pray vnto
God, that he turning away his indignation, would bridle the deuill, who now
rageth in the world. For ye haue heard of a great calamitie, how many
thouſand haue bene ſlayne, it is to be feared that they are all damned. God
requireth obedience of vs, &amp; he hath pronounced the ſentence, that he
that taketh the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword. They were
beſieged of Satan, who knoweth whether the ſame ſhall come vnto vs? Let
vs pray God therefore that his kingdom may come vnto vs, that Chriſtians may
be multiplied, and that he will ſend wiſe and meeke Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whom the
people may receiue and obey. Let him that knoweth the gift of God, pray for
others which haue not yet heard the word of God. For it is hie time ſo to
doe.</p>

Goſpell, foraſmuch as it is preached of euery yeare: notwithſtanding
becauſe occaſion is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine offered, we muſt againe entreat and
preach of it. Firſt the Euangeliſt ſayth, that Chriſt tooke his
Diſciples aſide, and ſayd vnto them ſecretly after this ſort:
<hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee that ye ſee. For I tell you that
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prophets and Kinges haue deſired to ſee thoſe thinges which ye
ſee, and haue not ſeene them, and to heare thoſe things which ye heare,
and haue not heard them.</hi> To ſee and heare is to be vnderſtoode here
ſimply of the outward ſeeing and hearing, to <pb n="393" facs="tcp:9413:205"/> wit,
that they ſawe Chriſt come in the fleſh, heard his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and were
preſent at thoſe miracles which he did among the Iewes. The Iewes ſawe
the ſame according to the fleſh, yea and felt them alſo: yet did they not
truely acknowledge him for Chriſt, as the Apoſtles did, and eſpecially
Peter in the name of all the reſt did confes him, ſaying: <hi>Thou art
Chriſt the Sonne of the liuing God.</hi> We graunt in deede, that there were
ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, which acknowledged him, as the Apoſtles did, but the
number of them was very ſmall, wherefore he taketh his Apoſtles here
ſeuerally vnto himſelfe. Many Prophets and Kings haue ſeene Chriſt,
howbeit in the ſpirit, as the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth to the Iewes of
Abraham, Ioh. 8:<note place="margin">How y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaw Chriſt before his
incarnation.</note> 
               <hi>Your father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham reioyced to ſee my daye, and he
ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> The Iewes thought then that he had ſpoken of the
bodely ſeeing, but he ſpake of the ſpirituall ſeeing, whereby all
Chriſtian heartes did behold him, before he was borne. For if Abraham ſaw
him, vndoutedly many other of the Prophets, in whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt was, ſaw
him alſo. And although this ſeeing ſaued the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Prophets,
yet did they alwayes with moſt inward and heartie affection deſire to ſee
Chriſt in the fleſh alſo, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſhewed in the Prophets.
Wherefore the Lord ſayth here vnto his diſciples, which ſawe him both in
the fleſh, and in the ſpirit: <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee
thoſe thinges that ye ſee.</hi> As if he ſaid: Now is the acceptable
yeare and time of grace: The matter which is now in hand is ſo weightie and
precious, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes are worthely ſaid to be bleſſed, which ſee it.
For now was the Goſpell preached openly and manifeſtly both by Chriſt
himſelfe, and alſo by his Apoſtles, whereupon he here calleth them all
bleſſed, which ſee and heare ſuch grace. Of which grace I haue preached
much &amp; a long time vnto you, I would to God ye did keepe that which I haue
ſpoken thereof, freſh in memorie.</p>
            <p>When the Lord ſpake theſe thinges, a certaine Lawyer ſtart
vp, ſhewing himſelfe as though he had bin ſome thing, who temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the
Lord ſayth: <hi>Maiſter, what shall I do to inherit eternall life?</hi>
This lawer was endued with wiſedome, and not vnſkilfull of the Scriptures,
which euen his aunſwere doth declare, yet in this place he is proued a foole,
yea he is brought vnto ſhame and ignominie. For Chriſt taketh awaye all his
glorying euen in one worde. He was of this mynde, that he had obſerued the
whole <pb n="394" facs="tcp:9413:206"/> Lawe, and that he was a certaine chiefe one in
reſpect of other, as vndoutedly he was, and thought himſelfe ſufficient
worthy by reaſon of his godlines and learning to be conuerſaunt with the
Lord. But what doth the Lord in this caſe? the text folowing declareth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he ſaid vnto him, what is written in the Lawe? how
readeſt thou? And he aunſwered and ſaid: Thou shalt loue thy Lord God
with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength,
and with all thy mynde, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Then he ſaid vnto
him, Thou haſt aunſwered right: do this, &amp; thou shalt liue.</hi> Me
thinkes that the Lord gaue this good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hard leſſon: he dealeth verie
ſtraitly with him, it may ſeeme to ſome that he ſhould haue ſpared
him a litle, he putteth him to ſhame ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly before all: he proueth that he
had done nothing, who notwithſtanding thought that he had done all thinges.
He aſked what he ſhould do: but I thinke he had enough and ouermuch to do,
if he had bin able to do more then he was. If I had time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things might
be ſpoken of theſe two commaundements. For they are the chiefe and
greateſt commaundements in Moſes, on which the whole Lawe, and all the
Prophets do hang, as Chriſt himſelfe ſayth in Matthew:<note place="margin">Matth. 22.40.</note> Notwithſtanding we will entreat ſomewhat
of them. If we conſider all the commaundements of Moſes, they haue
reſpect altogether vnto loue. For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: <hi>Thou shall haue

6.4.5.</note> ſo Moſes expoundeth it in Deuteronomie, where he ſayth
thus: <hi>Heare O Iſraell, the Lord our God is Lord onely. And thou shalt
loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all
thy might:</hi> from whence the Lawer tooke his aunſwere. But the Iewes
vnderſtand this commaundement ſo, that they thinke it to extend no further,
then that they ſhould not ſet vp, nor worſhip idols. And if they can
ſay and witnes in mouth, that they haue one God onely, and do worſhip none
but him, they thinke they haue obſerued this commaundement. After the ſame
ſort did this Lawer vnderſtand it, but that was an euell and a wrong
vnderſtand thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be

requireth all thine heart, <pb n="395" facs="tcp:9413:206"/> ſoule and ſtrength. It
ſpeaketh not of the toung, not of the hand, not of the knees, but of the
whole man, what ſoeuer thou art and haſt. That no other God may be
worſhipped of me, it ſhalbe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that I haue the true and only
God in myne heart, that is, I muſt loue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myne heart, ſo that I do
alwayes depend on on him, truſt in him, repoſe my hope in him, haue my
pleaſure, loue and ioy in him, and daily remember him. Euen as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
if we take pleaſure of any thinge, we ſay, it doth me good inwardly at the
heart. And if any ſpeaketh or laugheth, and doth it not in good earneſt,
neither from his heart, we are wont to ſay: Thou laugheſt in deede, but it
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not from thine heart. The loue of the heart in the Scriptures
ſignifieth a vehement &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall loue, which we ought to beare toward
God. They which ſerue God with mouth, hands, and knees onely, are hypocrites,
neither hath God any care of them. For God will not haue part, but the whole.
The Iewes did outwardly abſtaine from idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and ſerued God alone in
mouth, but their heart was farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from him, being full of diffidence
and vnbeleefe. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they ſeemed to be verie earneſt in ſeruing God,
but within they were full of idolatrie. Whereupon the Lord ſaid vnto them
Matth. 23: <hi>VVoe be to you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites, for ye are
like vnto painted ſepulchers, which appeare beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full outward, but are
within full of dead mens bones, and of all filthines. So are ye alſo: For
outward ye appeare righteous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, but within ye are full of hypocriſie
and iniquitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe wicked ones, which glorie of the outward
thinge, which go about to iuſtifie and make themſelues good by their owne
workes, after the maner of this Lawer. Conſider how great the pride of this
aſſe was, he commeth forth as though he could not be blamed or rebuked of
the Lord, he thought, yea it ſeemed vnto him, that the Lord would here
commend and praiſe his life before the people. He thought not to learne any
thing of the Lord, but he ſought onely his owne commendation, he would
willingly haue had Chriſt to ſet forth his praiſe, toward whom the eyes
of all were bent, and who was an admiration to all. So all hypocrites do,
outwardly they pretend excellent,<note place="margin">The qualitie of
hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</note> great and weightie workes: they ſay that they haue
reſpect neither of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nor praiſe, but within in their heart they are
full of ambition, and wiſh that their holines were knowen to the whole world,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:9413:207"/> ſhewing a goodly ſigne of their religion, by the
byting of their lippe, if they heare any ſpeake thereof. But our Sauiour
Chriſt ſheweth here no kyndnes or ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes to this Lawyer, inaſmuch as
he putteth him to ſhame: that great holy man notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding continueth
ſtill in the ſame mynde, and ſuppoſeth that he ſhall receiue great
honour, &amp; ſingular praiſe becauſe of his precious life, thinking that
he had fulfilled the commaundement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo he looketh for a ioyfull
aunſwere, that the Lord ſhould ſay: Good maiſter, your maiſterſhip
hath done all thinges. But Chriſt aunſwereth him: <hi>Do this.</hi> Which
in deede is as much to ſay as: Thou art altogether a naughtie felowe, thou
haſt neuer in all thy life fulfilled ſo much as one letter thereof, ſo
ſhewing vnto him how euell and naughtie he was.</p>
            <p>Like vnto this Lawyer are all they which do moſt grieuouſly
offend againſt the firſt commaundement, and thinke that God is to be loued
no more then the wordes ſound for, and that thereby it is fulfilled: the
commaundement therefore remaineth in their mouth, and doth as it were flote
aboue the heart, and pearſeth it not:<note place="margin">How God muſt be
lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs.</note> but I muſt go much farther then ſo, I muſt loue God
ſo, that I can be content to forſake all creatures for his ſake, and if
it ſhall ſeeme good vnto him, my body and life, I muſt loue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all things, for he is ielous, and can not ſuffer that any thing be loued
aboue him, but vnder him he permitteth vs to loue any thinge. Euen as the
huſband can ſuffer, that his wife loue her maydes, the houſe, houſhold
thinges, cattel, and ſuch like, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he ſuffereth her not to loue any
with that loue wherewith ſhe is bound vnto him, but himſelfe, yea he will
haue her leaue all ſuch thinges for his ſake. Againe the wife requireth the
ſame of her huſband. After the ſame ſort God can ſuffer that we loue
his creatures, yea therefore they are created, &amp; are good. The ſunne is a
goodly creature, gold and ſiluer, and whatſoeuer by nature is faire,
procureth vs to loue it, which maketh it deare vnto vs, neither is God offended
thereat. But that I ſhould cleaue vnto the creature, and loue it equally with
him, that neither will he, neither can he ſuffer: yea he will haue me both to
deny and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all theſe thinges, when he requireth it of me, and will
haue me content, although I neuer ſee the ſunne, money, riches, &amp;c: The
loue of creatures muſt be farre inferiour to the loue which we muſt beare
toward him. As he is the ſoueraigne good, ſo <pb n="397" facs="tcp:9413:207"/> will he
alſo be chiefly loued before all other good thinges, If he will not ſuffer
that I ſhal loue any thing equally with him, much leſſe will he ſuffer
that I ſhall loue any thing aboue him.</p>
            <p>Thou ſeeſt now as I thinke, what it is to loue God with all
the heart, with all the ſoule, with all the mynde.<note place="margin">What it
is to loue God with all the heart.</note> To loue God with all the heart, is to
loue God aboue all creatures, that is, although creatures be verie amiable and
deare vnto me, and I take great delight in them, yet muſt I ſo loue them,
that I do contemne and forſake them, when my God and Lord requireth that of
me.</p>
            <p>To loue God with all the ſoule,<note place="margin">What it is to
loue God with all the ſoule.</note> is to beſtow our whole life &amp; body
at his pleaſure, as if the loue of creatures, or any tentation aſſaile
thee, or would ouercome thee, thou mayſt ſay: I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part from all
theſe then I will forſake my God, whether he caſt me of, either kill me,
either drowne me, or whatſoeuer through his permiſſion ſhall come vnto
me, I had rather leaue all thinges then him, I will depend on that my Lord,
rather then vpon all creatures, or vpon any other thing whatſoeuer it be.
Whatſoeuer I haue and am, I will beſtow, but him will I not forſake. The
ſoule in the Scriptures ſignifieth the life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp;
whatſoeuer is done by the fiue ſenſes, as to eate, to drinke, to
ſleepe, to wake, to ſee, to heare, to ſmell, to taſte, and
whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the ſoule worketh by the bodye.<note place="margin">To loue God
with all the ſtrength.</note> To loue God with all the ſtrength, is for
Gods cauſe to renounce all the members and limmes of the body, ſo that one
will offer to perill whatſoeuer he is able in his fleſh and body, before he
will commit that which is againſt God. To loue God with all the minde,<note place="margin">To loue God with all the mynde.</note> is to enterpriſe nothing
but that which many pleaſe God, whereby he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the thought,
which is in man, that that alſo be referred to God, and to all thinges that
be acceptable vnto him. Thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueſt now what this commaundement of God
containeth in it. Thou ſhalt loue God, Thou, Thou ſayth he, and that wholy,
euen euerie part of thee, not thy handes, not thy mouth, not thy knees alone.
They which do theſe thinges, as it is ſaid, do truely fulfill it: but no
man liueth in the earth which doth ſo, yea we do all otherwiſe. Wherefore
the law doth here make vs all ſinners, ſo that not ſo much as the leaſt
iote or point thereof is fulfilled of them that are moſt holy of all in the
world. For no man doth ſo cleaue with all his heart vnto God, that he can
leaue all thinges <pb n="398" facs="tcp:9413:208"/> for his ſake. We (alas) are gone
ſo farre, that we can not ſuffer ſo much as a litle word, nay we will not
forgoe the value of a halpenie for Gods cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">We are farre of from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God as we
ought.</note>How can it be that we ſhould loue God, when his will is not
ſetled in our mynde? If I loue God, I can not but loue his will alſo. Now
if God ſend ſicknes, pouertie, ſhame, and ignominie, it is his will,
whereat what do we? we murmur, we grudge, our mynde is caried hither and
thither, we take it moſt vnpatiently, and yet is this the leaſt. What would
we do, if we ſhould leaue our body and life for God &amp; Chriſt his
ſake? then would we ſhew our ſelues after an other ſort. But in the
meane ſeaſon we do like vnto this Phariſe &amp; Lawyer, we lead an
honeſt life outwardly, we worſhip God, we ſerue him, we faſt, we pray,
and behaue our ſelues in outward appearaunce iuſtly and holily. But God
doth not require that of vs, but that we ſhould bend our ſelues to do his
will with pleaſure and loue, cheerefully &amp; louingly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatſoeuer the Lord ſayth here to the Lawyer, he ſayth it to all vs, to
wit, that we haue yet done nothing, but that all thinges do yet remaine to be
done. All men therefore are giltie of death and ſubiect to Satan: All men are
lyers, vaine, filthie, and whatſoeuer they pretend, it is nothing worth. We
are wiſe in our owne matters, that we may ſcrape togither money and goods,
and we can ſpeake moſt ſweetely and fayrely before men, and cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly
propound or ſet forth our matter. What doth God care for theſe thinges? He
requireth of vs that we loue him with our whole heart, which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing is
able to performe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of this place is inferred, that we are all
ſynners, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they, whoſe life hath a goodly outward ſhew
onely. This is the former part of this text, namely, the preaching of the law:
Now followeth the other part, which is the preaching of the Goſpell, which
declareth how we may fulfill the lawe, and from whence that fulfilling is to be
taken, which we ſhall learne of that Samaritane.</p>
            <p>What doth the Lawyer moreouer, after that the Lord had thus delt
with him? He, ſaith the Euangeliſt, willing to iuſtifie himſelfe,
ſpake vnto the Lord &amp; aſked him as followeth: <hi>Who is then my
neighbour?</hi> He aſketh not: Who is my God? As if he ſayd: I owe nothing
vnto God, neither do I want any thing before God, yea it ſeemeth vnto me,
that I do neither owe any <pb n="399" facs="tcp:9413:208"/> thing to any man: neuertheles
I would willingly know who is my neighbour. The Lord aunſwering him, bringeth
forth a moſt goodly ſimilitude, whereby he declareth that we are all
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours one to an other, as well he that giueth a benefit, as he that
receiueth and needeth one: although by the text it ſeemeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that
he onely is a neighbour, which beſtoweth a benefit vpon an other. But the
Scripture maketh here no difference, ſometime calling him our neighbour,
which beſtoweth a benefit, ſometime him that receiueth a benefite. By this
ſimilitude the Lord inferreth in theſe wordes: <hi>Go and do thou
likewiſe,</hi> ſo that that Lawyer had offended not onely againſt God,
but alſo againſt man, and wanted not onely loue towardes God, but alſo
loue towardes his neighbour, vnto whom he had not done that good which he
ought. This wretched felow is brought into ſuch a caſe that he is found
wholy euell, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the head to the feete. How came it to paſſe that he
being moſt ſkillfull of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not beware of this? So fell it
out: he led a phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, hypocriticall, and counterfaite life, which had
not regarde vnto his neigbour, and to ſuccour and helpe others, but ſought
thereby onely glorie and honour before men, and ſo looked by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent &amp;
diſſolute liuing to come to heauen. But ye haue heard verie often, that a
Chriſtian life conſiſteth in this,<note place="margin">A Chriſtian
life.</note> that we deale with faith and the heart in thinges that pertaine
vnto God, but vſe our life and workes towards our neighbour, and that I
muſt not looke while my neighbour ſeeketh a benefite, and requireth ſome
thing of me, but according to my duty muſt preuent his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp; of
myne owne accord offer my liberalitie vnto him. Now we will ſee what the
parable containeth in it.</p>
            <p>The Samaritane in this place is without all doute our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, who hath declared his loue toward God and men:<note place="margin">The
loue of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God &amp; men.</note> Toward God, in that he
deſcended from heauen, and was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſo fulfilled the will of his
father: Toward men, for that by and by after baptiſme, he beganne to preach,
to worke mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to heale the ſicke, neither was there any worke that he
did, which did concerne himſelfe onely, but all his workes were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to
his neighbour, being made our miniſter, when as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he is
aboue all, and equall to God: but he did all theſe thinges, for that he knew
that they did pleaſe God, and that it was the will of his father. When he had
aſcended to the <pb n="400" facs="tcp:9413:209"/> heighth of the commaundement, that he
loued God with all his heart, he left and committed the life of his body, and
whatſoeuer he had to the pleaſure and will of his father ſaying: Father,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all thinges that I haue, my life and ſoule are readie at thy will: I
leaue for thy ſake the glorie and honour which I haue had among men, yea and
all thinges how good ſoeuer they be, that the world may vnderſtand how
greatly I loue thee: My father let for thy ſake my wiſedome be contemned,
that the worlde may count me for the fooliſheſt of all: Now make I my
ſelfe moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of all other, who was before praiſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
whole world: Now am I as a moſt wicked theefe, who before was liberall,
profitable, and beneficial to the whole world: My father, I make no account of
all theſe thinges, that I may be found obedient to thy will. This is that
Samaritane, who being deſired by no prayers, came, &amp; fulfilled the law
with his whole heart, he alone hath fulfilled it, which praiſe none can take
from him: he alone hath deſerued it, and to him onely it appertaineth.</p>
            <p>But whereas he is touched with care of the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded man, hath
compaſſion on him, byndeth vp his woundes, bringeth him with him into an
Inne,<note place="margin">The woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, &amp; the theeues that ſpoiled
him.</note> prouideth for him, that pertaineth vnto vs. The man which lieth
half dead, wounded, beaten, &amp; ſpoiled, is Adam, yea and all we. The
theeues which ſpoiled vs, wounded vs, and left vs halfe dead, as yet a litle
pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, are the Deuels. The horſe and his ſitter do here fall downe, we
are not able to helpe our ſelues, and if we ſhould be left lying ſo, we
ſhould die, through great anguiſh and diſtres, our woundes would become
feſtred, and our affliction miſerable and exceeding great. This excellent
parable is ſet before our eyes, liuely painting forth vnto vs, what we are,
what is the ſtrength of our reaſon and free will. If that wretched man had
gone about to helpe himſelfe, his caſe would haue bene made worſe, he
would haue hurt himſelfe, he would haue opened his woundes with rubbing,
&amp; ſo would haue fallen into greater calamitie. Againe if he had bin left
lying, it had bin all one. So it commeth to paſſe when we are left to our
ſelues: our ſtudies and endeuour ſurely are nothing, howſoeuer we ſet
vpon the matter. Hitherto ſundrie waies &amp; diuers meanes haue bin
inuented, whereby we might come vnto heauen, and amend our life, this man found
out this, an other that, whereupon haue increaſed innumerable ſortes of
Orders, letters of indulgences, <pb n="401" facs="tcp:9413:209"/> pilgrimages to
ſaincts, which did alwayes make y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie worſe. This
is the world which is painted forth in this wounded man, he being wholy laden
with ſynnes, fainteth vnder ſo heauie a burden, and is not able to helpe
him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But the Samaritane who hath fulfilled the Lawe, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſound and whole, commeth, and doth more, then either the Prieſt or Leuite,
he byndeth vp his woundes, poureth in oyle and wine, ſetteth him vpon his
owne beaſt, bringeth him with him vnto an Inne, maketh prouiſion for him,
and when he ſhould depart, diligently commendeth him to the hoſt, and
leaueth with him ſufficient for expenſes, none of which either the
Prieſt, or Leuite did. By the Prieſt the holy Fathers are ſignified,<note place="margin">The Prieſt &amp; Leuite which paſſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> which flouriſhed before Moſes. The Leuite is a repreſentation
of the Prieſthood of the old Teſtament. Now all theſe could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by their workes, but paſſed by like vnto this Prieſt and Leuite.
Wherefore although I had all the good workes of Noe, Abraham, yea and of all
the faithfull Fathers, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit me nothing. The Prieſt and Leuite
ſaw that miſerable man lie wounded, but they could not helpe him any
thinge: they ſaw him lie halfe dead, but what was that to the purpoſe? they
could not giue him any remedy. The holy Fathers ſawe men drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and plunged
in ſynnes euen vp to the eares, they alſo felt the ſting and anguiſh of
ſynne, but what could they doe hereunto? they could make the caſe worſe
and not better. And thoſe were the preachers of the Lawe, which ſhew what
the world is, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is full of ſynne, and lieth halfe dead, and can
not euen any whit helpe it ſelfe with his ſtrength, reaſon, and free
will. But Chriſt is that true Samaritane,<note place="margin">Chriſt the true
Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane which helpeth the wounded man. Oyle.</note> who is touched with as
great care of that miſerable man as of himſelfe. Neither doth the
Samaritane call him vnto him, for he hath no merit, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth the meere
grace and mercy of Chriſt, who byndeth vp his woundes, and hauing great care
of him, poureth in oyle and wine, that is, the whole Goſpell. He poureth in
oyle when grace is preached, when it is ſayd: beholde O miſerable man, this
is thy incredulitie, this is thy condemnation, thus art thou wounded and
ſicke: but abyde, I will ſhew thee a remedy for all this: Behold, ioyne thy
ſelfe to this Samaritane Chriſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, he will beſt helpe and
ſuccour thee, and beſide him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The nature of oyle, as he know, is
to make ſoft and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie: <pb n="402" facs="tcp:9413:210"/> ſo the ſweete and
gentle preaching of the Goſpell maketh my heart ſoft and tender toward God
and my neighbour, ſo that I dare beſtow my body and life, for Chriſt and
his Goſpell, if God and neede ſo require.<note place="margin">Wine.</note>
Sharpe wine ſignifieth rhe holy croſſe or affliction, which forwith
followeth. Neither is there any cauſe that a Chriſtian ſhould looke farre
about and ſeeke the croſſe, for it ſooner hangeth ouer his head then he
is aware of, as Paul wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth 2. Tim. 3: <hi>All that will liue godly in
Chriſt Ieſus, shall ſuffer perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> This is the cogniſance
and badge of this king. He that is aſhamed of this cogniſance, pertaineth
not vnto him. Moreouer that Samaritane putteth this wounded man vpon his owne
beaſt: this is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who beareth vs, we ly vpon his
ſhoulders, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his necke &amp; body. There is ſcarce a more amiable &amp;
comfortable hiſtorie in the whole Goſpell, then where Chriſt compareth
himſelfe to a ſhepeheard, which carieth againe the loſt ſheepe vpon his
ſhoulders vnto the flocke.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Inne whereunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wounded ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is brought,
&amp; the hoſt to whom he is committed.</note>The Inne is the ſtate of
Chriſtianitie in this world, wherein we muſt abide for a litle time. The
hoſt is the miniſters &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the worde of God, and of the
Goſpell, whoſe charge is to haue care of vs. This therefore is the ſumme:
The kingdome of Chriſt is a kingdome of mercy and grace, where is nothing els
but alwayes to be borne and to beare. Chriſt beareth our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and
infirmitie, he taketh our ſynnes vpon himſelfe, and beareth our fall
willingly, we daily lie vpon his necke, neither is he wearied with that bearing
of vs. It is the dutie of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of this kingdome, to comfort
conſciences, to handle them gently, to feede them with the Goſpell, to
beare the weake, to heale the ſicke: Moreouer they ought fitly to applie the
worde according to the neede of euerie one. This is in deede is the dutie of a
true Biſhop and preacher, not to proceede by violence and iniurie, as it is
the cuſtome of our biſhops at this daye, which vex, torment, and crie out:
goe to, goe to, he that will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, ſhalbe compelled to doe it
againſt his will. We muſt in no wiſe doe ſo. But a Biſhop or preacher
ought to behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a healer of the ſicke, who dealeth verie
tenderly with them, vttereth verie louing words vnto them, talketh very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them, and beſtoweth all his endeuour about them. The ſame muſt a
Biſhop, or miniſter of any particular pariſh do, and thinke no
otherwiſe, but that his biſhoprike or pariſh is as an 
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:9413:210"/> hoſpitall, wherein are ſuch as are combred with
diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kyndes of diſeaſes. If Chriſt be thus preached,
then faith and loue come togither, which fulfill the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of loue. Now
foraſmuch as the knowledge of the Lawe and the Goſpel, and of the
difference betweene them is verie neceſſarie, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of them
ſomwhat more at large.</p>

miniſter that which is good and wholeſom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie it. So ſtandeth the
caſe here: The Lawe reuealeth the diſeaſe, the Goſpell miniſtreth the
medecine. Which is manifeſt eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the text whereof we haue already
intreated: The Lawyer commeth, and being verie deſirous of eternall life,
aſketh what he muſt do. The Lawe declareth it vnto him, ſaying:<note place="margin">The office of the Lawe.</note> Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God
with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy ſtrength, and with
all thy minde, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. He that readeth theſe workes
after a bare and ſclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort onely, as this Lawyer did, vnderſtandeth
them not. We muſt pearce into the Lawe, and euerie one behold his face and
heart therein. God muſt be loued of me from the bottom of my heart: Againe, I
muſt loue him with all my ſoule, that is, from the depth of my ſoule,
ſo that I throughly feele in my ſelfe that I loue him. For to loue with the
ſoule ſignifieth in the Scripture ſuch loue as a yong man beareth toward
a mayd, which he feeleth throughly in his minde, Moreouer, with all my
ſtrength, that is, with all my members. Alſo with all my mynde, that is,
all my ſenſes, cogitations &amp; thoughts muſt be directed vnto God: Now
I finde in my ſelfe that I do none of theſe. For if I muſt loue God with
all my heart, ſoule, ſtrength and minde, it is requiſite, that myne eyes
ſhew no angrie twinckling or motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſpeak no angrie word,
that my feete, handes, eares, &amp;c. ſhew no ſigne of wrath, that my whole
body euen from the crowne of the head to the ſoles of the feete, &amp; all
things belonging thereunto, do walke <pb n="404" facs="tcp:9413:211"/> in charitie, be as
it were rauiſhed with loue and pleaſure toward God, &amp; alwaies ſerue
&amp; worſhip him. Wherfore who is he which by the pleaſure &amp; loue of
vertue is chaſt &amp; righteous? there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be one ſuch fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
earth. For we alwayes finde our ſelues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to wrath, hatred, enuie,
worldly pleaſure &amp;c: then to meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; other vertues. I finde in me
not onely a ſparke, but euen a fierie fornace of wicked luſt: for there is
no loue in myne heart, no not in all my members. Wherefore here in the Lawe as
it were in a certaine glaſſe I ſee whatſoeuer is in me, to be damnable
and curſed. For not one iote of the Law muſt periſh, but all muſt be
fulfilled,<note place="margin">Matth. 5 18.</note> as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Truly
I ſay vnto you, till heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth paſſe, one iote or title of the
Lawe shall not ſcape, till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> Now thou fyndeſt not
this in thee, that thou doeſt with all thy ſoule and heart, with
cheerefulnes and pleaſure, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Law exacteth and requireth of
thee. Hereupon thou art damned and vnder the dominion of Satan.</p>
               <p>The Lawe therefore ſerueth vs thus farre, to teach vs, that we
are condemned: for by it we fynde all wicked deſyres in vs, and yet not ſo
much as a ſparke of them ought to be in vs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our Scholemen not
marking this, haue taught, that if one do according to his abilitie, God doeth
giue his grace vnto him. They are blynde guides: They graunt themſelues, that
a man is caried with no pleaſure or cheerefulnes to that which is good, and
yet do they alſo teach, if one worketh, although it be with griefe,
difficultie, and ſlouthfulnes, that it is well with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. But
Chriſt hath taught otherwiſe in this place, that we ſhould worke that
which is good with pleaſure and loue, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines and facilitie. Whom therefore
ſhall we rather beleeue, Chriſt or the Scholemen: but I leaue that to your
iudgement. Of ſuch corrupt and euell vnderſtanding of the Lawe,
Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries afterwardes came, whereby entred in this opinion, that it was
thought to be ſufficient to ſaluation, to liue in a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to
follow the orders thereof, although that were done euen with griefe of
mynde.<note place="margin">We muſt worke with pleaſure and cheerefulnes, not
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or griefe.</note> So they taught: But Chriſt will haue vs to
worke with pleaſure and cheerefulnes, ſo that if any thinge be done with
burden or griefe of conſcience, it is ſynne: remoue thy ſelfe therefore
quickly from ſuch a worke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus it might be ſaid vnto them:
Behold O man, thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creature oughteſt to be caried with a
certaine delight to <pb n="405" facs="tcp:9413:211"/> the doinge of the lawe of God, but
thou commeſt with no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or cheerefulnes hereunto, now ſee that
thou ſhew thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and loue herein, otherwiſe thou ſhalt be the
enemie of God, and the friend of Satan: thus men leauing their owne raſhnes,
might come to the knowledge of themſelues, and might then ſay: Therefore, O
God, am I condemned, and that not vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hereupon it followeth, that we
are all vnder Satan, as long as we feele in vs this difficultie and hardnes to
doe that which is good. Wherefore if I ſhould ſpeake the trueth, I ſhould
ſay thus, I fynde in deede ſomethinge that is good in the lawe of God, but
it is my death, and if it could be, I would wiſh that it were not. So are all
men affected in their heart, as S. Paule plainly teacheth Rom. 7. If we
ſhould remaine in ſuch condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we muſt needes periſh for
euer.</p>
               <p>There is therefore an other part, that is, the Goſpell,<note place="margin">The office of the Goſpell.</note> which ſheweth comfort and
ſaluation, declaring where that is to be had, whereby the Lawe is fulfilled.
When therefore I know by the Lawe that I am a condemned man, then ly I halfe
dead among theeues, Satan hath ſpoiled my ſoule, and hath moreouer in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
taken away all faith, all righteouſnes, and hath left nothing but bodily
life, which is alſo qulckly extinguiſhed. Then come Leuites and Prieſtes,
which teach this and that, but can helpe nothing, and ſo paſſe by. But
when the Samaritane commeth, he helpeth: that is, when Chriſt commeth, he
ſheweth his mercy vnto vs, ſaying after this ſort: Behold thou oughteſt
in deede to loue God with all thine heart, but thou doeſt it not, now beleeue
onely in me, &amp; thou ſhalt enioy my obedience as thine owne: this onely
helpeth me: Then he putteth me on his owne beaſt, that is, on himſelfe, and
carieth me into the Inne, that is, into the Church of the faithfull, then he by
and by poureth his grace into me, that is, oyle, that I may feele my ſelfe to
be layd vpon his ſhoulder, that at the laſt maketh me to be of a good
cheere, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et &amp; well affected in conſcience. Afterward he poureth
in wine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which with his ſharpnes may abate &amp; tame the force of
old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. And yet am I not ſo wholy reſtored vnto health, health is in
deede poured in &amp; begon, but not yet wholy finiſhed: then Chriſt hath
care of me, &amp; by his grace poured into me, doth purifie me, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day
to day I may become more chaſt, meeke, ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp;c: vntill I
wholy dy, for then I ſhalbe altogether made <pb n="406" facs="tcp:9413:212"/> perfect.
So when we ſhall come to God the father, and be asked of him, whether we
beleeued in God, whether we loued him, &amp;c: the Samaritane Chriſt our
Lord, who hath layed vs on his owne beaſt, will come forth and ſaye: Loe
Father, although they haue not wholy fulfilled thy Lawe, yet haue I fulfilled
it, ſuffer thou that to turne to the commoditie of them that beleeue in me.
So is it needefull that all the Saincts albeit verie holy, be layed vpon the
backe of Chriſt. If ſo be that the holieſt of all, as the Prieſtes and
Leuites could not ſatiſfie the Lawe, how ſhall we go about with our
fained workes, as with ſhauing, habit &amp;c, to fulfill the ſame? O
wretched &amp; miſerable calamitie. Theſe things ſhall now ſuffize to
haue bin ſpoken concerning this text: Let vs pray vnto God, that he will giue
vs his grace. *** *</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N excellent example of faith is ſet forth in this text, of
what ſort it is, of what nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, namely, that it is not a
reſting or idle thinge, but liuely and voyd of idlenes,<note place="margin">A
true fayth is not idle, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more and more.</note> which goeth not
backe, but proceedeth on, and ſtill more and more increaſeth. Which if it
be not done, it is no faith, but onely a dead opinion of God in the heart. For
a true and ſyncere faith, which the holy Ghoſt poureth into the heart, can
not be idle: which I ſay for this cauſe, that no man be therefore ſecure,
albeit he hath obtained faith, neither that he ſtay there. It is nothing to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, vnleſſe we increaſe by continual going forward, and come to
greater knowledge of God. For on the contrarie ſide it is the nature and
qualitie of our aduerſarie Satan, not to be idle, as S. Peter ſayth: Satan
ſleepeth not, but goeth about as a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, ſeeking whom he may
deuoure. If ſo be that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is neither idle, neither ſleepe commeth
vpon him, neither ſhall it be meete for a Chriſtian to be idle or put his
handes in <pb n="408" facs="tcp:9413:213"/> his boſom, foraſmuch as he hath the Deuell
his enemie, who is ſtronger then himſelfe: for he is called the prince of
the world, as it is mentioned in the Epiſtle appointed to be read in the
Church on this day:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.12.</note> 
               <hi>VVe wreſtle
not againſt flesh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers,
&amp; againſt the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouernours, the princes of the darkenes of this
world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which are in hie places.</hi>
This prince gouerneth the world, furiouſly and fiercely rageth, and can not
ſuffer the proſperous ſucces of a Chriſtian. Neither is it for his
profit to be ſuffered of him, for an entrie being made hereby, his kingdome
is burſt into, and his net torne in peeces, out of which as much as he is
able, he ſuffereth no Chriſtian to eſcape. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer when the fire of
faith is kindled, and the flame foſtered, and Satan trieth and marketh that,
by and by he practizeth deceit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, for he knoweth how much
hinderaunce his kingdome ſhall take thereby, wherefore as earneſtly as he
can, euen with all his power, he defendeth his kingdome, &amp; laboureth to
keepe all in obedience to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not free from

them.</note>Wherefore it is moſt certaine, that when a Chriſtian hath begon
to beleeue, by and by tentation and perſecution will aſſaile him. Which
if it come not to paſſe, it is a ſigne that his faith is not yet ſound,
and that he hath not as yet truly receiued the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For wicked Satan
hath a verie ſharpe ſight, he by and by ſpieth out where is a true
Chriſtian, wherefore he applieth himſelfe wholy vnto this, that he may
enforce him to fall, and may beſiege him, and aſſaile him on euerie
ſide: for he can not ſuffer that any ſhould reuolt from his kingdome. It
is perilous therefore for a man to beleeue, for the Deuill is ready that he may
ſet vpon him, and ouerthrowe him, which ſometime chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth euen to verie
holy men, which vnderſtand the word of God well,<note place="margin">The
Saincts of God doe ſometimes fall eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly.</note> when they
ſtand vpright, and thinke themſelues ſafe, that priuie wicked fende
commeth vpon them by litle and litle, and wraſtleth with them ſo longe,
till he ouerthrow them, and caſt them to the earth. Set before thine eyes
Moſes and Aaron, who were guides of the Iewes, they had an excellent fayth,
when they brought the people out of Egypt, and all the people in fayth
paſſed through the redde ſea, death, the wide wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and many other
meruelous thinges, whereby they ſhewed their fayth, but at the laſt they
fall grieuouſly, they feare that <pb n="409" facs="tcp:9413:213"/> they ſhall periſh
with hunger. Is it not a thinge moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that by ſo great
ſignes they ſhew their faith, they goe into death and through death,
wraſtle with it, and ouercome it, and yet while they thinke them ſelues
ſureſt, they fal, and ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ouercome of the belly,
murmure againſt God, and are ſo grieuouſly tempted, that they fall all
togither. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not certaine and ſure, if one begin to beleue, and
doth not alwayes more and more increaſe in faith. Yea that godly man Moſes,
who had ſo great and ſo ſtrong a faith, did fall alſo, when as he
ſhould bring water out of the rocke with a ſtaffe, he douted, and talked
thus to the people: Come let vs ſee whether we can bring water out of the
rocke. That good Moſes, which had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many and ſo great
ſignes, falleth into reaſon and carnall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, fearing leſt
the incredulitie of the people would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great a miracle &amp;
ſigne. But it had behoued him to cleaue faſt to the word of God, and to
thinke it higher, greater, ſtronger, and mightier, then the vnbeleefe of the
people: that great man was tempted, he ſtumbled, and was ouerthrowne.</p>
            <p>We haue like examples in the newe Teſtament:<note place="margin">Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heede leſt he
fall.</note> Peter was hardie, and firme in faith, when he beheld Chriſt vpon
the water, he ſayd vnto him with a ſtrong faith: Lord ſuffer me to come
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, committing him ſelfe to the water euen as to the ſhip, he
thought aſſuredly that the water would beare him. Then was there an
excellent faith in Peter, and great courage, which durſt commit him ſelfe
wholy vnto death in the middeſt of the ſea, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his hope freely
&amp; boldly in Chriſt. But when he thought him ſelf moſt ſafe, a
ſtorme and tempeſt ariſeth, he forgetting the word, ſuffereth his faith
to faile, and he him ſelfe alſo falleth, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Satan to plucke faith
out of his hart. Faith truely is a ſubtill and delicate thing, a ſmall
thing maketh vs to ſtumble and fall. Satan is alwaies watchfull, and
circumſpect, and doth by &amp; by obtaine his purpoſe, if we doe not
diligently watch. How ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly did the common people followe Chriſt? they
thought that he was a Prophet, and did ſo cleaue vnto him, and ſo defend
him, that the Princes of the people were made aſtonied, neither durſt they
ſo much as lay hand on him. But when they apprehend him, proceede againſt
him, faſten him to the croſſe, the people forſake him all that they
may, and come no more at him. A Prophet is preſent, and no man any more
aſſiſteth him, but they rather crie <pb n="410" facs="tcp:9413:214"/> out againſt
him, crucifie him, crucifie him: and that which is moſt deteſtable of all,
his owne Diſciples reuolt from him. What is become now both of their faith
and holines?</p>
            <p>So is it at this day in our time: at the firſt when the
Goſpell began to ſhine, the preaching thereof was acceptable and
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, then many ſeemed willing to embrace it, but when Munkes.
ſacrificing Prieſts, Nunnes, &amp;c. began to be ſpoken againſt, and
the Maſſe to be confuted, all (a meruelous thinge to be ſpoken) fell away
as leaues of trees. Againe, when Princes alſo were touched, the Goſpel
ſuffered greater perſecution, and did by litle and litle daily decreaſe.
Moreouer Satan is not idle, whereupon he ſtirreth vp hereſies and
ſchiſmes, for how many ſects haue we hitherto ſuffered? he ſleepeth
not, he will ſtirre vp greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes alſo, he neuer reſteth, but
looketh about, and trieth euery way, that he may bringe the matter to that
paſſe, and preuaile ſo farre, that no ſound doctrine may remaine in the
church, but that if all Germanie be diligently viewed, a ſermon may no where
be found, wherein the word of God is truely preached, as it was before. He
goeth about to extinguiſh and aboliſh all the doctrine of Chriſt now
increaſing, for he can not abide it. It is not an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing to auoid
ſo great an enemie, he lyeth in wait, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all places, and ſo
diligently beſtirreth him ſelfe, that euen the learned fall, and the elect
ſtumble, as Moſes, S. Peter, with the reſt of the Apoſtles. We thinke
our ſelues ſafe, and liue ſecurely, no man conſidereth, no man hath a
care of the worde, we ſhould pray &amp; beſeech God, that he would
vouchſafe to preſerue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and make his holy name to be ſpred
and publiſhed more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. But no man is touched with care hereof, no man
prayeth that it may haue good ſucceſſe. Wherefore it is to be feared that
at the laſt it will come to paſſe, that God will ſuffer Satan and vs to
runne togither into one, then ſhal we be in a deſperate caſe, for he will
eaſily throw vs to the ground, when we are come into ſo great miſerie by
our owne ſlothfulnes and default.</p>
            <p>Satan moreouer can ſo ſette forth the matter by ſeditious
ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,<note place="margin">We muſt not truſt to our owne ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth but
to the helpe &amp; aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God.</note> that men ſhall thinke it
to be iuſt. As the Arrians were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that their opinion was ſound.
But a Chriſtian humbleth him ſelfe, taketh nothing raſhly vpon him
ſelfe, but with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hart ſayth thus vnto God: Moſte gracious God,
albeit I knowe that the cauſe which I fauour is not vniuſt, yet without 
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:9413:214"/> thy helpe I am not able to maintaine it, thou therfore
help me, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I ſhall be caſt and ouerthrowne. He is in deede
certaine of his cauſe, euen as S. Peter was on the water, who could not be
ſurer, when the water did beare him. For he knewe no let or hinderance, but
when the winde was great, and the water trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, be perceiued what was
wanting in him: Which is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be receiued into our minde, and
conſidered of vs. For albeit the certaintie of our cauſe be confirmed,
ſtrengthened, and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with plaine ſentences of the Scripture, yet is
it by the might, counſell, and power of God, that we are defended, and Satan
our chiefe aduerſary and enemie repreſſed. Which is therefore done, that
God may ſtirre vs vp to watch, and keepe vs in awe, that we may alwayes be
watchfull, and crie vnto him: Lorde helpe vs, &amp; increaſe our faith, for
without thee we are able to doe nothing. Our hart muſt be alwayes ſo
diſpoſed, as though we beganne to day to beleeue, and alwaies ſo
affected, that we deſire and labour to goe more and more forward. For that is
the nature, force, and qualitie of faith, that it alwayes increaſeth and
waxeth ſtronger. Satan, as it is a litle before mentioned, neither is idle,
nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, if he be once ouerthrowne he riſeth againe, if he can not
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in by the dore, he endeuoureth to ſteale in on the backe ſide, &amp;
if this be not permitted him, he breaketh in through the roofe, or entereth in
through a hollow place digged vnder the threſhold, for he doth ſo long
earneſtly follow his worke, vntill he come in, he vſeth many deceits and
practizes, if he preuaileth not by one, he taketh in hand an other, and doth
that ſo long, vntill he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his purpoſe. Man is a weake and a
miſerable thing, as S. Paule ſayth 2. Cor. 4: <hi>VVe haue this treaſure
in earthen veſſels.</hi> I am more fraile then a pot compared to the
potter, and a pot is a very weake thinge, inaſmuch as it is eaſily broken,
and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is in it, is ſpilt.</p>
            <p>Now Satan when he marketh how great a treaſure faith is, kept in
a fraile pot (that I may ſo ſpeake) he is in a great rage &amp; furie, and
ſayth thus vnto vs: I will touch thee, I will breake thy potte, thou haſt a
great treaſure, which I will ſpill.<note place="margin">Though we be of our
ſelues moſt fraile and weake, yet God ſetteth vs in the middeſt of
moſt ſtronge enemies, that it may appeare that we ſtand not by our owne
ſtrength, but by the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar helpe &amp; aſſiſtance of God.</note>
So God ſetteth the ſilly pot in the middeſt of enemies, which ſhould
vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh euen in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if he did not defend it, for it may
quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſhaken and broken in peeces, yea if it be but bitten of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
it periſheth. And it is not hard from Satan euen in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:9413:215"/> to waſte and deſtroy a whole cuntry. Wherfore that
vexeth him, that God dealeth with him ſo ſimply, ſetting a ſilly potte
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when as he notwithſtanding is ſo great a Prince and the
moſt mighty ruler of this world. Now it would grieue me, if I being ſtronge
and valiant, any man ſhould ſet vpon me with a reede, ſurely I being
moued with anger would breake the reede in peeces: for I had leuer that he
would ſet vpon me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſpeare, ſword, and armed on all partes. It
grieued ſtout Goliath, that Dauid durſt come vnto him vnarmed onely with a
ſtaffe. So it greatly grieueth the deuill, that God will ſuppreſſe him
by fleſh &amp; blood, if ſome ſtout ſpirit ſhould reſiſt him, it
would not grieue him ſo much, for that troubleth him aboue meaſure, that a
ſilly worme, a fraile pot ſhould come to deſpiſe him, an earthen
veſſell againſt a moſt mighty Prince. God hath layd vp this treaſure,
ſayth Paul, in a miſerable and weake veſſell: for man is a weake
creature, by and by moued to wrath, to couetouſnes, to pride, &amp;c. ſo
that Satan may eaſily ſhake and breake the veſſell: for if God woulde
permit him, he woulde forthwith breake it all to peeces. Now all this is done,
ſayth Paul, that we may know, that not by our own power, but by the power of
God we are preſerued from all euills, and eſpecially from the force and
furie of Satan, who goeth about like a roring lyon, deſiring to bruſe and
breake the weake veſſells and fraile pots: and that we may hereby alſo be
ſtirred vp to be watchfull and to lift vp our eyes toward heauen, and pray
vnto God that he will vouchſafe to encreaſe and defend our faith, and
preſerue the veſſell by his ſtrength. Thus haue we an entrance vnto our
text, it remaineth that we doe now conſider the ſame in order: The
Euangeliſt ſayth thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There was a certaine ruler, whoſe ſonne was ſicke at
Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum.</hi> It falleth out with many other men alſo, that they haue
their children ſicke: but that which he ſayth afterward is to be marked:
<hi>VVhen he heard that Ieſus was come out of Iudea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Galile, he went
vnto him, and beſought him that he woulde goe downe, and heale his ſonne:
for he was euen ready to dye.</hi> Here faith beginneth and truſteth in
Chriſt. Nowe that he had faith the Goſpell declareth: for he heard of
Chriſt how he healed the ſicke, thereupon his hart was ſet vpon him, and
he reſorteth vnto him, thinking thus: If he helpeth all men, he will alſo
helpe me, and will heale my ſonne. He counteth Chriſt for ſuch a man 
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:9413:215"/> as is able to helpe men, and hopeth and promiſeth to
him ſelfe all goodnes from him: and that in deede is a true Chriſtian hart,
which cleaueth faſt vnto God. If that this ruler had ſtoode in a place or
way hauing two pathes, douting with him ſelfe, he had not gone vnto Chriſt,
but his hart would haue bene thus affected: He helpeth others in deede, but who
can tell, whether he will help me alſo? Howbeit he doth not thus dout of
Chriſt, but riſeth, and maketh haſt vnto him. This is the beginning of
faith, now ye ſhal ſee how Chriſt meeteth him on the other ſide, and
aunſwereth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then he thought for, that his faith might be tried,
and thus he ſayth vnto him:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders ye will not beleeue.</hi>
Chriſt ſayd alſo to S. Peter Matth. 14: <hi>VVhy dooſt thou dout, O
thou of litle faith?</hi> Peter vndoutedly had faith, &amp; did beleue in
Chriſt, whereupon he committed him ſelfe to the water, but when he ſaw
the winde, he was afraide, and beganne to be drowned: ſo in this place, that
good man heareth a good report of Chriſt, that he hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth euery man, which
he beleeueth and therefore reſorteth vnto him. But when he heareth that
Chriſt denieth to come, he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, and his faith faileth, fearing that
Chriſt would not come vnto him. This is as it were an aſſault &amp;
ſore blowe, here his new begun faith beginneth to be tempted. It was a hard
ſaying: <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not beleeue:</hi>
which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth ſo tempt him, and bring him into dout, that he almoſt
fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. Satan ſtanding at his backe, ſayth vnto him: get thee home and
looke to thy buſines, for he will not helpe thee. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the
ruler did not by and by leaue of, but prayed the Lorde moreouer: <hi>Lorde come
downe before my ſonne dye.</hi> Here his faith began to be in daunger &amp;
to faile, but God doth not forſake him, but lifteth him vp againe, and
ſayth vnto him:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goe thy way, thy ſonne liueth.</hi> If the ruler had not had
faith, he woulde not haue requeſted Chriſt to come to his ſonne. What
therefore doth he want? euen this: he beleeued if Chriſt came to his houſe,
he coulde then helpe his ſonne, if he did not come, he could not helpe him.
Neither did his faith extende ſo farre, as to beleeue that Chriſt euen
being abſent could heale the ſicke: but it behoued that he ſhould haue a
higher faith. Wherfore Chriſt lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him vp, and ſetteth him in a higher
ſtate, and ſayth vnto him: <hi>Goe thy way, thy ſonne liueth.</hi> Here
he firſt aſcendeth from his <pb n="414" facs="tcp:9413:216"/> former faith, whereby he
beleeued that Chriſt could heale being preſent, and commeth to a higher
faith, ſo that now he beleeueth the word. For if he had not beleeued the
word, he would not haue left Chriſt, neither would haue departed from him,
vntill he had come with him to his houſe. But hauing layd holde on the word,
he cleaueth vnto it by faith, for his ſonne is at home, and Chriſt is with
his father. Wherefore the Father receiueth this word in his hart, and thinketh
with him ſelfe after this ſort: My ſonne is ſicke, but I ſhall find
him whole: which faith was contrary both to reaſon &amp; experience. Reaſon
would haue thought thus: When I came from my ſonne he was ſicke,<note place="margin">True
faith leaueth all wiſedom and reaſon, and truſteth to the onely word of
God.</note> as I did leaue him, ſo ſhall I find him. But faith ſayth
otherwiſe, it reſteth onely in the word &amp; truſteth wholy vnto it,
neither douteth it, that any thing will fall out otherwiſe then the word
ſpeaketh: <hi>Goe thy way, thy ſonne liueth.</hi> This is a right and a
ſtronge faith, when as man leaueth ſenſe, wiſedome, reaſon, and
truſteth wholy to the worde of God. Chriſt ſayth, <hi>thy ſonne
liueth:</hi> And he ſayth with him ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dout it is true, I
ſhall ſo find it. So faith remaineth not idle, nor reſteth, but
increaſeth and goeth forward.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt dealeth with vs alſo, he ſuffereth vs to be
temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that we may increaſe in faith: if in the ende of our life when we
muſt dye, we ſhall haue but a ſparke of ſuch faith, we ſhall be in a
good caſe, as Chriſt ſayth vnto his Diſciples Matth. 17: <hi>If ye haue
faith as much as is a graine of muſterd ſeede, ye shal ſay vnto this
mountaine: Remoue hence to yonder place, &amp; it shall be remoued: and nothing
shal be vnpoſſible vnto you.</hi> A graine of muſterd ſeede is but a
ſmall thing, but he that hath faith agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſmalnes of this
graine, ſhall be ſaued. Neither muſt we ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider this, that
our faith is litle, but we muſt looke vnto this, we muſt haue regard vnto
this, that the graine of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterd ſeede do remaine, and be not eaten vp of
the birdes, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan plucke not faith out of our hartes. We muſt not looke
how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the faith is, but we muſt regarde and take heede that faith be not
taken away. Peter had faith vpon the ſea, and therefore was he caried of the
water, that he ſhould not be drowned, if he had ſo perſeuered in faith,
he might well haue walked an hundred miles vpon the ſea, but when he fayled
in faith, he began to be drowned. So Moſes had a ſtronge faith, but he fell
from it. It conſiſteth not in the ſtrength or ſlendernes of faith, that
we doe ſtand, but in <pb n="415" facs="tcp:9413:216"/> perſeuering and remaining
faithfull. It may be that he ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in faith, which hath but a
ſlender faith, and he that hath a ſtrong faith ſhall fall and dout.
Moſes and Peter had an excellent faith, ſo that Moſes by faith did leade
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ſea and death, and Peter without
douting went downe out of the ſhip into the ſea, but they fall from their
faith, howbeit God raiſeth them vp quickly again. But the Theefe on the
croſſe hauing once layd hold of faith, continued conſtant. Nowe God
therefore ſuffereth it to be thus, that he may bring down raſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie,
that we doe not gloriouſly extol our ſelues, but alwaies remaine in feare
&amp; awe. For when tentation commeth vpon vs, we doe forthwith fal into
errour, if God do not aſſiſt &amp; ſtrengthen vs, of which thinge we
may ſee a very goodly ſimilitude in a tree,<note place="margin">A proper
&amp; apt ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> which in the ſpring time buddeth and openeth
it ſelfe, ſo that it doth as it were become white by reaſon of the
bloſſoms. A ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er falling vpon it, many of the bloſſoms are
ſhaken of, &amp; the froſt alſo doth much more conſume them. Afterward
when the frute beginneth to ſpring forth, ſome great winde blowing, much of
it being newly come forth falleth downe, and when it waxeth ripe, the
caterpiller commeth, which with other wormes gnaweth &amp; ſpoyleth it ſo
much, that ſcarce the twentieth part, yea ſcarce the hundreth part many
times remaineth. The ſame commeth to paſſe with the hearers of the
Goſpell, in the beginning thereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one coueteth to be a true
Chriſtian, euery one liketh of it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and the firſt frutes thereof
are very pleaſant. But when winde, a ſhower, or tentation commeth, all fall
away from it by companies: afterwards ſects and ſeditions ariſe, which
like vnto wormes and kankers gnaw and infect the frutes of the Goſpell, and
ſo many falſe opinions ſpring vp, that very few doe perſeuer in the
true profeſſion of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>We haue here, thankes be giuen to Almighty God, the worde of God
plentifully taught, we are deliuered out of deepe &amp; great darkenes, but we
forgetting the word are made weake, we liue hauing no care of the word, for it
is not ſauory vnto vs. But when as hereafter falſe prophets ſhall breake
in with their corrupt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and Satan alſo ſhall violently aſſaile
vs, finding vs idle, and the houſe ſwept and garniſhed, he will bring
with him ſeuen other ſpirits worſe then him ſelf, and the ende ſhall
be worſe then the beginning. Which thinges if they ſo fall out, let vs not
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="416" facs="tcp:9413:217"/> be quite diſcouraged, but let vs rather
inſtruct one an other, that we may learne to cleaue vnto God, and pray vnto
him, and ſay: Mercifull God, thou haſt giuen vnto me to become a
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, giue vnto me alſo that I may perſeuer, and become daily
richer in faith. Albeit the whole world did reſiſt, and euery one
conſpired to deſtroy the Goſpell, yet wil I be nothing moued, but by thy
diuine helpe will depend on the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>But to returne againe to the Ruler, ye haue heard that his faith
was very notable and excellent, he heareth the worde, <hi>thy ſonne
liueth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They which beleeue ſhal aſſuredly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
al good thinges that they pray vnto God for.</note> he beleeueth it, and goeth
away giuing honour to God, he receiueth the only word, he truſteth wholy vnto
it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God dealeth ſo graciouſly with him, that he reſtoreth
health vnto his ſonne, raiſeth him vp, and ſtrengthneth him in faith,
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffereth him to ſticke in dout or infirmitie, but
eſtabliſheth him, and maketh him ſtronge, and cauſeth him to goe
forward &amp; increaſe. Neither doth God delay vntill he commeth home, but
declareth vnto him being yet in his iorney the helth of his ſonne, ſending
his ſeruaunts to meete him, that they might bringe him good newes, and ſay:
thy ſonne liueth. For God can not differre or delay, where there is a
ſincere hart, which truſteth in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, all other thinges being left,
looking onely vnto the word of God, there God can not hide him ſelfe, but
reuealeth him ſelfe, &amp; commeth vnto ſuch a hart, &amp; maketh his abode
there, as the Lord ſayth Ioh. 14. Now what can be more ioyful, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to giue credit to the word of God, &amp; to be plucked from it by no
afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or tentation, but to ſhut his eyes againſt euery aſſault of
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to lay aſide humane ſenſe, vnderſtanding, reaſon, &amp;
wiſedom, and to ſay daily in his hart: God hath ſpoken it, he can not
lye. I ſay nothing is more ioyfull then ſuch a faith. For whatſoeuer we
aſke of God with ſuch a faith, we receiue it more aboundantly of him, then
euer we deſired it, and God is ſooner preſent with vs, then we had
thought. Hereupon the Euangeliſt vſeth ſo many wordes euen vnprofitable,
as it appeareth vnto vs, as theſe: <hi>The man beleeued the word that Ieſus
had ſpoken vnto him, and went his vvay. And as he vvas novv going dovvne, his
ſeruaunts met him, ſaying, Thy ſonne liueth. Then inquired he of them the
houre vvhen he began to amend: and they ſayd vnto him: Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday the
ſeuenth houre the feuer left him. Then the father knevv, that it vvas the
ſame houre in the vvhich Ieſus ſayd vnto <pb n="417" facs="tcp:9413:217"/> him: Thy
ſonne liueth.</hi> All which tende vnto this ende, that we ſhould know that
if we beleeue in the Lord he will giue vs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, whatſoeuer we ſhall
pray vnto him for.</p>
            <p>The concluſion the Euangeliſt maketh as followeth: <hi>And he
beleeued, and all his houshold.</hi> He ſo increaſed in faith, that he did
not onely aſcend from a low ſtate to a higher, but he brought others alſo
vnto faith. He had ſurely an effectuall faith, which did not reſt idle and
ſlothfull in the hart, but did breake forth, ſo that whoſoeuer were in
his houſe were brought vnto faith.<note place="margin">The nature and qualitie
of true faith.</note> For this is plainely the nature of faith, this is the
qualitie of it, to drawe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto it, to burſt forth, and apply it ſelf
euen vnto the worke of loue, as S. Paule witneſſeth Galat. 5: That faith
which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by loue, is effectuall. For it can not keepe ſilence or be
i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as Dauid ſayth Pſal. 116, which place Paule applieth to the
faithfull 2. Cor. 4: <hi>I beleeued, &amp; therefore haue I ſpoken.</hi>
Faith can doe no other, for it is enforced to ſpeake, neither can it keepe
ſilence, inaſmuch as he that is endued with it, endeuoureth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit his
neighbour. This ruler had faith for him ſelfe, but it doth not remaine in him
alone, but breaketh forth. For without all dout he declared to his familie, how
he came vnto Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued comfort of him, which they alſo beleued.
So we alſo, when we beleeue muſt open our mouth, and confeſſe the
grace, which God hath ſhewed vnto vs.<note place="margin">The moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellent
work of faith.</note> Which is the chiefe and moſt excellent worke of faith,
that one inſtruct an other in the worde. For Paule ſayth Rom. 10: <hi>VVith
the hart man beleeueth vnto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and with the mouth man
confeſſeth to ſaluation.</hi> If we be aſhamed of this word, it is a
certaine argument of a very light &amp; vncertaine faith. We ſee therfore
that there is no difference with Chriſt betwene the ſtrong and the weake in
faith: for a litle faith is faith alſo. He therefore came into the world that
he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to him ſelfe, beare and ſuſtaine the weake. If he were
ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient as we be, he would by and by ſay vnto vs: Get thee from me, I
wil none of thee, becauſe thou beleeueſt not in me. But this is a thing
greatly to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, when one can handle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weake gently, and doth not
deale rigorouſly with them, and repell them by impatiencie. For although they
be weake to day, the houre may come, when they ſhall receiue the word more
aboundantly then we. Thus we ought to inſtruct and teach one an other, that
we may depend on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word of God. For if we continue in ſticking 
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:9413:218"/> to the word, we ſhall be ſtronge enough for the
deuill: for we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the word, albeit we be but weake. Vnto Satan, who is
able euen in one houre to ouerthrow vs all, all men ſhould be euen as a
fether, which he would be able to remoue away how and when he will, yea euen
with his breath, but if we beleeue, that fether is made more heauy vnto him
then the hill Olympus. For a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian beareth Chriſt in him ſelfe, and
Chriſt is heauier then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth. Thus much may ſuffize concerning
this text.</p>

gouernment is not, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſinne is pardooned, neither is there the Goſpell
nor kingdome. Wherefore thoſe two kingdoms are to be ſeparated: one, wherin
ſinnes are puniſhed, &amp; an other wherin they are forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the law is exacted, &amp; wherein that which is due by the lawe, is
remitted.<note place="margin">The kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace.</note> In the kingdom of God,
where he reigneth by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, there is no exacting of the lawe, neither
any dealing by the law, but onely remiſſion and forgiuenes, neither wrath
nor puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, but brotherly ſeruice and well doing one to an other.
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ciuill law or Magiſtrate is not taken away, for this
parable ſpeaketh not any thing of worldly gouernment, but of the kingdom of
God only. Wherefore he that is yet gouerned onely by the regiment of the world,
is yet farre of from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen, for worldly gouernment pertaineth
wholy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour thinges. As if a Prince gouerne his people ſo, that he
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iniurie to be done to none, puniſhing offenders, he doth wel, &amp;
is therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. For in that gouernment this ſentence
flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth:<note place="margin">Ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> Pay that thou
oweſt: which if thou doe not, thou ſhalt be caſt into priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Such
gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we muſt haue, howbeit we come not to heauen by it, neither is the
world therefore ſaued, but this gouernment is therefore neceſſary, that
the world do not become worſe. For it is only a defence &amp; fortification
againſt wickednes, which if it were not, one would deuoure an other, neither
could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man keepe in ſafetie his owne life, wife, goods, children, &amp;c.
That therfore all things ſhould not fal, come to ruine and periſh, God hath
appointed the ſword of the Magiſtrate, whereby wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes may be partly
repreſſed, peace and quietnes among men maintained, &amp; one may not doe
an other iniurie, wherefore this is in any wiſe to be kept. But, as I ſayd,
it is not ordained for them that are in the kingdom of grace, but therefore
onely, that men be not more deepely plunged in wickednes, and become
worſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore no man that is onely vnder the regiment of the 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:9413:219"/> world, ought to glory, that he doth therefore well
before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom all is yet vnrighteous. For thou muſt come ſo
farre, that thou do reſigne that which is iuſt before the world, &amp;
yeeld of thine owne right. This the Goſpell doth here require,<note place="margin">As the Lord forgiueth vs, ſo muſt we alſo forgiue our
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> which on either ſide ſetteth forth vnto vs onely
forgiuenes. Firſt the Lord forgiueth the ſeruaunt all the dette: then he
requireth of him, that he forgiue his fellow ſeruaunt his, and remit his
offence. Theſe thinges God requireth, and ſo muſt his kingdom be ordered:
that no man be ſo wicked, neither ſuffer him ſelfe ſo to be moued, that
he can not forgiue his neighbour. And as it is a litle before this text taught
in the Goſpel, if he ſhould prouoke thee to anger euen ſeuenty times
ſeuen times, that is as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he can offend againſt thee, thou muſt
yeeld of thine owne right, and cheerefully forgiue him all thinges. Why ſo?
becauſe Chriſt did the ſame. For he ſet vp &amp; erected ſuch a
kingdome, as wherein is onely grace, which muſt at no time ceaſſe, ſo
that if thou repent all things may who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be forgiuen thee, as often as thou
ſhalt offend, foraſmuch as he hath ordained the Goſpell, that it might
preach no puniſhment but onely grace &amp; forgiuenes of ſinnes. This
kingdom ſtanding, thou mayſt alwaies riſe again, how deepely ſoeuer
thou falleſt, &amp; ſo often as thou falleſt, ſo as thou repent. For
albeit thou falleſt, yet this Goſpell &amp; mercie ſeate alwaies
continueth. As ſoone as therfore thou haſt riſen againe &amp; returned,
thou haſt grace reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Howbeit he requireth this of thee, that thou
alſo forgiue thy neighbour all things, which he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt
thee, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou ſhalt not be in this kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace, neither
ſhalt beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e partaker of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell preacheth, that thy ſinnes
may be forgiuen thee. This briefly is the ſumme &amp; meaning of this
text.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we muſt not here omit, to declare who they be that
receiue the Goſpell, and vnto whom it is acceptable. For ſurely that
kingdom and gouernment, wherin God reigneth and ruleth by the Goſpell, is
moſt excellent and gentle, foraſmuch as in it meere forgiuenes of ſinnes
is preached, howebeit it pearſeth not into the hart of euery one, neither is
it conſidered or eſteemed of all. For thou mayſt finde many light and
vnconſtant men,<note place="margin">Abuſe of the Goſpell.</note> who
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the Goſpel, and leade their life diſſolutely and looſely,
doing what they liſt, who thinke that they ſhould be rebuked of none,
ſeeing that the Goſpel teacheth nothing but forgiuenes of ſinnes. The
Goſpell is not preached to theſe, who do ſo vilely eſteeme of 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:9413:220"/> a precious treaſure, and deale lightly with it.
Wherefore neither doe they pertaine to this kingdom but to worldly gouernment,
that they may be ſtopped &amp; let from doing whatſoeuer they like and
liſt.<note place="margin">To whom the Goſpel is preached.</note> To whom then
is it preached? to them which throughly feele ſuch miſerie, as this
ſeruaunt did here. Wherefore conſider what happeneth vnto him: The Lord
taketh pitie of his miſerie, forgiueth him more then he durſt deſire. But
before this is done, the text ſayth, the Lord firſt tooke account of his
ſeruaunts, and when he began to recken, one was brought vnto him, which ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him ten thouſand talents: and becauſe he had nothing to pay, his Lord
commaunded him to be ſold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had,
and the dette to be payed. Which truely were no pleaſant wordes, but euen
exceeding ſeueritie and moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iudgement, then is he brought into
ſo great perplexitie and diſtreſſe, that he falleth downe on the
ground, and aſketh mercie, and promiſeth more then he hath, or is able to
pay, ſaying: Lord refraine thyne anger toward me, and I will pay thee
all.</p>
            <p>Here is ſet forth vnto vs, who they be, vnto whom the Goſpell
is acceptable. For ſo commeth it to paſſe betwene God and vs. When God
will take an account of vs, he ſendeth forth the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his law,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the law.</note> whereby we learne to know what
we ought to doe: as when God ſayth to the conſcience: Thou ſhalt
worſhip no other God, but ſhalt acknowledge me alone for God, ſhalt loue
me with all thine hart, and repoſe thy truſt and hope in me onely. This is
the booke of accounts, wherein is written what we owe, which he taking into his
hands, readeth before vs, and ſayth. Lo, this thou oughteſt to haue done,
thou oughteſt to feare, loue, and worſhip me alone, thou oughteſt to
truſt in me alone, and from me to promiſe to thy ſelfe all good thinges.
Howbeit thou dooſt otherwiſe, thou art mine aduerſarie, thou beleeueſt
not in me, but repoſeſt thy truſt in other things: and in a ſumme, thou
feeſt here, that thou dooſt not obſerue ſo much as the leaſt point of
the lawe. When the conſcience hath heard theſe thinges, and the law hath
touched one well, he ſeeth then what he ought to doe, and what he hath not
done, and findeth that he hath not kept ſo much as a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the law, and
is compelled to confeſſe, that he hath not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that obedience and
dutie which God iuſtly requireth of him. What doth the Lord now? When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
conſcience is thus tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and feeleth it ſelfe condemned, and is
diſtreſſed with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <pb n="423" facs="tcp:9413:220"/> great miſerie, he
ſayth: Sell him, and whatſoeuer he hath, and let him pay the det. This is
the iudgement, which forthwith followeth, when the law hath reuealed ſinne,
and ſayd: This thou muſt doe, that thou oughteſt to haue done, and thou
haſt done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof: for to ſinne is required puniſhment, that man
may be compelled to pay. For God hath not ſo made his lawe, that he doth not
puniſh them that tranſgreſſe it. It is not ſweete &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
but bringeth bitter and horrible paine with it, it deliuereth vs to Satan, it
caſteth vs downe to hell, and leaueth vs wrapped in tentation, vntill we haue
payed the vtmoſt farthing. This S. Paule hath notably well declared Rom. 4,
where he ſayth: <hi>The law worketh nothing but wrath.</hi> That is, when it
reuealeth vnto vs, that we haue done vniuſtly, it ſetteth nothing before
vs, but wrath &amp; indignation. For when the conſcienee ſeeth that it hath
committed euill, it feeleth that it hath deſerued eternall death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which followeth puniſhment, whereupon it is compelled to deſpeire.</p>
            <p>This is that that the Lorde commaundeth this ſeruaunt togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all his ſubſtance to be ſolde, foraſmuch as he is not able to pay.
But what doth the ſeruaunt ſay? the fooliſh fellow thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth yet, that he
ſhall pay the dette, he falleth downe and prayeth that he wil haue patience
with him. This is the wound and croſſe of all conſciences, that when
ſinne biteth them ſo, that they feele in how euill caſe they are before
God, there is no reſt in them, but they runne hither and thither, ſeeking
about, that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from ſinnes, &amp; raſhly take vpon them
as yet to do ſo great thinges, as wherewith they ſhall pay God,<note place="margin">Superſtitious meanes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by men to be deliuered from
ſinne, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Gods fauour.</note> as we hitherto haue bene
inſtructed, whereupon came ſo many pilgrimages, collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate houſes,
Monaſteries, Maſſes, &amp; other trifles. We pyned our ſelues with
faſting, we ſcourged our ſelues with whippes, we were made Monkes and
Nunnes, therefore onely, for that we went about to leade ſuch a life, and to
do ſuch and ſo many works, as whereunto God might haue reſpect, and
thereby be pacified, thinking ſo to appeaſe and make quiet our
conſciences, ſo we committed the ſame thinges that this fooliſh fellow
did. Such a hart as is touched with the lawe, &amp; throughly feeleth it owne
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and calamitie, is humbled truely and in deede. Whereupon it falleth
downe before the Lord and craueth mercy, Howbeit it is yet defiled with this
vice, that it ſtriueth to helpe it ſelfe, which <pb n="424" facs="tcp:9413:221"/>
thinge can not be taken away from nature. When as the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence feeleth
ſuch miſerie, it dareth preſume to promiſe more then all the Angells in
heauen are able to performe. Then is it an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter to perſuade it to
apply it ſelfe to doe, whatſoeuer can be required of it. For it findeth it
ſelfe alwayes in ſuch a caſe, that it hopeth that it is able by workes to
ſatisfie for ſinnes. Conſider thoſe thinges which haue bene hitherto of
longe time done in the world, then ſhalt thou find theſe thinges to be
ſo: For thus was it preached: Giue ſomewhat to the building of a Church:
Get to be admitted into an holy Monaſterie, inſtitute Maſſes, and thy
ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen thee. And when conſciences were vrged in
confeſſion, they would not ſticke to ſay: Whatſoeuer was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined
vs, we haue omitted nothing of it, yea we haue giuen more then we were
commaunded. Miſerable men reioyced that by this meanes they might prouide for
them ſelues, and therefore they pyned and afflicted them ſelues, that they
might be vnburdened of their ſinnes, yet did it preuaile them nothing. For
the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence remained in dout as before, that it knewe not how it ſtoode
before God. But if it were ſecure and quiet, it fell into that which is
worſe, to thinke that God hath reſpect vnto workes, neither can reaſon
doe any other but depend of works. The Lord ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is touched w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> affection
of mercy toward that miſery, wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruaunt ſo entangled &amp;
ſnared w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſinnes, is holden, &amp; taking pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vpon him, doth forgiue
and dimiſſe him. Here is now ſet forth vnto vs, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpecial
office &amp; qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel, &amp; how God dealeth with vs. When thou
art ſo drowned in ſinnes, &amp; wearieſt thy ſelf, that thou mayſt
deliuer thy ſelfe from them, the Goſpell commeth to thee,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell.</note> &amp; ſayth: Doe not
ſo deare brother, it preuaileth nothing, although thou afflict and torment
thy ſelfe euen til thou be mad, thy works do not profit, but the mercy of God
ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee, who is touched with thy miſerie: for he ſeeth thee
wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in calamitie, &amp; wearying thy ſelf, that thou mayſt deliuer thy
ſelfe out of the myre, &amp; yet art not able: he, I ſay, hath regard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, that thou art not able to pay, wherupon he forgiueth thee all, and that
of his meere mercie. For he doth not forgiue thee the dette eyther for thy
workes or merits, but for that he taketh pittie vppon thy crie, complainte and
mourning, and thy falling downe before his knees: that is, God hath reſpect
to an humbled hart, as the Prophet ſayth Pſal. 51: <hi>The ſacrifice of
God is a <pb n="445" facs="tcp:9413:221"/> troubled ſpirit: a broken &amp; contrite
hart, O God, shalt thou not deſpiſe.</hi> Such a hart he ſaith, as is
broken and humbled, which is not able to helpe it ſelfe, but craueth the
helpe of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth in it, ſuch a heart is an acceptable ſacrifice
to God, and he that hath it is in the right way to heauen. Now God hauing
ſhewed this mercy vnto him, and taken pitie on his miſerie, ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to followe his right, and abrogateth it, and ſayth no more: Sell whatſoeuer
thou haſt and pay the dette: although he might go forward and ſay: Thou
muſt paye, for this my lawe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, which I will not haue abrogated for
thy ſake: yet will he not deale with him by the lawe, but chaungeth the lawe
into grace and fauour, taketh pittie on him, and dimiſſeth him with his
wife, children, and all his ſubſtance, and doth alſo forgiue him the
dette.</p>
            <p>This is that which God ſuffereth to be preached by the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: vnto him that beleeueth is remitted not onely the fault, but alſo
the puniſhment, and that of meere mercy, not for any works ſake. For he
that preacheth, that by workes the fault and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment may be put
awaie, hath euen then denied the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Mercy and merit
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not agree togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> foraſmuch as theſe two can not agree
togither, that God hath mercy on thee, and yet that thou doeſt merit ſome
thinge. For if it be grace, it is not merit: but if it be merit, then ſhall
it not be grace, but dette: for if thou pay thy dette, he ſheweth thee no
mercy: but if he ſheweth thee mercy, thou doeſt not make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Wherefore we muſt needes acknowledge his mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, we muſt receiue
of him, and beleeue in him, which the Goſpel here requireth. After therefore
that this ſeruaunt is thus humbled with the knowledge of his ſynne, the
word is exceeding comfortable vnto him, wherein the Lord pronounceth him free,
and forgiueth him both the fault and the puniſhment.<note place="margin">Whom
the preaching of the Goſpell profiteth.</note> Whereby is alſo declared,
that it toucheth not ſluggiſh hearts, that feele no ſynne, neither
thoſe that are caried with raſhnes, but onely ſuch afflicted
conſciences, as are preſſed with the heauie burden of their ſynnes,
which do greatly deſire to be deliuered from them, of them God hath mercy,
and forgiueth them all. Wherefore it behoued this ſeruaunt to receiue the
word, for vnles he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, forgiuenes had profited nothing, nay there
had bene no forgiuenes at all. It is not therefore enough, that God ſuffereth
remiſſion of ſynnes, and a golden yeare full of grace to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched 
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:9413:222"/> vnto vs, but it is neceſſarie that we receiue and
beleeue it in heart. If thou beleeue, thou art free from ſynnes. This is the
firſt part of a Chriſtian life, which both this place and diuers other in
the Goſpels do teach vs, which conſiſteth properly in faith, which alone
hath to do before God: whereby alſo is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Goſpell can not
be receiued but of a troubled and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable conſcience.</p>
            <p>Herupon now may be inferred that they are plaine deluſions,
whatſoeuer thinges are any otherwiſe taught concerning our workes, and free
will, to wit, that they put away ſinnes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine grace. For the diuine
maieſtie alone, beholding our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hath pittie vpon vs, for the text
ſheweth manifeſtly, that God pardoneth and forgiueth them, that haue
nothing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that we haue nothing left, wherewith we may pay God.
Howſoeuer therefore thou haſt free will in temporall matters, yet thou
heareſt here that it is nothing before God. Wherefore if thou deſire to be
deliuered from thy ſynnes, thou muſt ceaſſe to truſt in any of thy
workes, and muſt plainly deſpeire concerning them, and flie vnto Chriſt,
pray vnto God for grace, finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Goſpell by faith.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the other part, wherein the felow ſeruaunt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is delt with. This ſeruaunt now hath enough, he ſaueth his body, goods,
wife, children, &amp;c. and hath his Lord fauourable vnto him. Wherfore he
ſhould ſurely be very fooliſh, if he ſhould now depart, and do what he
is able for the reconciliation of his Lord, for his Lord might worthely ſay
that he is mocked of him. He hath neede therefore of no worke, but that he
receiue ſuch grace &amp; fauour as is offered him, ſo may he be of a good
cheere, giuing thankes to his Lord, and dealing ſo with others as his Lord
hath delt with him. After the ſame ſort is it with vs, for when we beleeue,
we haue God fauourable &amp; mercifull vnto vs, neither do we neede any thing
more,<note place="margin">We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour by our workes to profit our
neighbour, &amp; not ſeeke to obtaine Gods fauour
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 line">
                     <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> but now it were time
that we ſhould forthwith die. Notwithſtanding if we muſt as yet liue
ſtill in the earth, our life ought to be ordered ſo, that we ſeeke not to
obtaine the fauour of God by workes. For he that doth this, doth mocke &amp;
diſhonour God, as it hath bin hitherto taught, that God is to be ſollicited
ſo ſong by good workes, prayers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, &amp; ſuch like, vntill we
obtaine his grace and fauour. We haue obtained grace, not by workes, but by
mercy, now if thou <pb n="427" facs="tcp:9413:222"/> muſt liue, thou muſt haue what to
doe, and wherewith to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie thy ſelfe, and it is meete that all this be
referred to thy neighbour.</p>
            <p>The ſeruaunt went out, as Chriſt ſayth, and found his fellow
ſeruaunt, whome he taketh by the throte and dealeth rigorouſly with him,
and will be wholy payd of him, ſhewing him no mercy or fauour at all. I haue
ſaid elſwhere, that Chriſtians muſt burſt forth by workes, &amp; by
their deedes before men witnes that they haue a ſyncere faith. God needeth no
workes, but faith ſuffizeth him, howbeit he therefore requireth them to be
done of thee, that by them thou mayſt ſhew thy faith, both before thy
ſelfe and alſo before the whole world, for he knoweth thy faith verie well,
but thou thy ſelfe and men do not yet throughly ſee it. Thou therefore
muſt direct ſuch workes ſo, that they may profit thy neighbour. Now
whereas this ſeruaunt ſhould thus haue done, what doth he? euen the ſame
that we doe, who ſeeme vnto our ſelues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and partly haue faith,
and are glad that we haue heard the Goſpell, whereof we can diſpute and
talke many thinges,<note place="margin">Buſie talkers &amp; ſlow
wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</note> but no man goeth about to expreſſe it in his life. We haue
brought the matter ſo farre, that the doctrine and trifles of Satan are
ſome what abated and layde aſyde, that we do now ſee and know, what is
iuſt, and what vniuſt: that we muſt haue to do with God by onely faith,
and by workes with our neighbour. But we can not bring it to this paſſe,
that loue may beginne, and doe that to an other which God hath done vnto vs, as
we our ſelues complaine, that many of vs are become worſe then they were
before. As therefore this ſeruaunt refuſed to remit his neighbour the
dette, and delt extremely with him, ſo alſo doe we, ſaying: It is not
meete that I ſhould giue that that is myne to an other, neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting myne owne
right. If this man hath prouoked me to anger, it is his dutie to pacifie me,
&amp; to labour by intreatie to put away myne anger. Truly thus the world
teacheth and doth, for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it to be iuſt and right. Neither will
any Prince or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate enforce thee to giue that which is thine to an
other, but wil ſuffer thee to do what pleaſeth thee with thine owne goods.
The magiſtrate in deede reſtrayneth thee from doinge what thou liſt with
the good of an other, but he conſtraineth thee not to giue thine owne
ſubſtaunce to an other, for that is againſt the Lawe of nations, which
euen reaſon pronouncing it, giueth to euerie <pb n="428" facs="tcp:9413:223"/> one that
which is his owne: wherefore he doth not vnequally or vniuſtly, which vſeth
his owne thinges at his will, &amp; taketh not away wrongfully the goods of an
other.</p>
            <p>But what doeth the Goſpell ſaye? If God alſo had held his
owne right, and ſayd: I do well in that I puniſh offenders, and take that
which is myne owne, who ſhall let me? what I pray you ſhould become of all
vs?<note place="margin">We muſt be mercifull to our brethren as God is
mercifull to vs.</note> We ſhould be thruſt downe to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Wherefore,
whereas he hath left his right toward thee, he will haue thee do the ſame
toward other: and therefore thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating thyne owne right, thinke thus with
thy ſelfe: If God hath forgiuen me tenne thouſand talents, why ſhould not
I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue my neighbour an hundred pence? God might haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his owne
right, neuertheleſſe he dothe not ſoe, but becommeth a fauourable Lorde
vnto thee, taketh pittie vpon thee, and forgiueth thee: why therefore
ſhouldeſt not thou doe likewiſe to thy neighbour? Wherefore if thou wilt
haue to doe in his kingdome, thou muſt doe as he doeth: but if thou haddeſt
rather remaine in the kingdome of the world, thou ſhalt neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his
kingdome. Hereunto pertaineth that ſentence, which Chriſt in the laſt
daye ſhall pronounce vpon the vnbeleeuers:<note place="margin">Matth.
25.</note> 
               <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meate: I thirſted, and ye
gaue me no drinke, &amp;c.</hi> But if thou contend here againſt:
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ye ſay, that God will not haue reſpect vnto workes,
neither will ſaue any becauſe of them. I ſaye he will haue them done
frankely and freely, not that we may merit any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but that we may
doe them to the profite of our neighbours, and witnes our ſyncere fayth by
them. For what haſt thou that thou mayſt giue him, and whereby thou mayſt
deſerue that he ſhould pardon whatſoeuer thou haſt committed againſt
him? Or what doth he get thereby? nothing truely, but that thou giueſt vnto
him praiſe and thanks. And this is the other part of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, the
name whereof is loue.</p>
            <p>They therefore that ſhew not their faith by the works of loue,
are ſuch ſeruaunts, as will haue themſelues forgiuen, when as they
notwithſtanding doe not forgiue their neighbour, neither yeeld of their owne
right,<note place="margin">They that will ſhew no mercy ſhall themſelues
finde none.</note> with whom it ſhall likewiſe fall out as it did with this
ſeruaunt. For when the other ſeruaunts (that is, the miniſters and
preachers of the Goſpell) ſhall ſee it, that God hath forgiuen them all,
and yet they will not forgiue any, they <pb n="429" facs="tcp:9413:223"/> are troubled,
that they are compelled to ſee ſuch thinges, and it grieueth them verie
ſore, that men doe ſo vndiſcreetly apply themſelues to the Goſpell,
and not rightly receiue it. What doe they then? They can do no other, but come
to their Lord, and complaine vnto him of ſuch thinges, and ſay: Lord, thus
it is: thou forgiueſt them both the fault and the puniſhment, yea
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneſt them all thinges, and yet we can not bring them ſo farre, as to
deale ſo with others as thou haſt delt with them. This is the complaint:
the Lord therefore will cauſe them to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the laſt
iudgement, and will lay theſe thinges againſt them ſaying: when thou
waſt afflicted with hunger, thirſt, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c: I did helpe thee:
when thou didſt ly drowned in ſynnes, I hauing mercy vpon thee, did forgiue
thee. Haſt thou done the ſame to thy neighbour? Then he ſhall pronounce
this ſentence on him: Thou wicked one, I was touched with mercy toward thee,
yea I yeelded of myne owne right, but thou wouldeſt not take pittie on
others, nor forgiue them their offence, wherefore thou ſhalt now pay thy
dette. Here is no grace and mercy, but moſt grieuous wrath and eternall
condemnation, then no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do helpe, wherefore he is compelled to holde his
peace, and is throwne hedlong into paine, vntill he pay the vttermoſt
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge. This is that which Sainct Peter hath ſpoken of them,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.21.</note> which after they haue heard the Goſpell,
notwithſtanding goe backe, that it had bin better for them, if they had neuer
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the waye of righteouſnes, then after they haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
it, to turne from the holy commaundement giuen vnto them. Why had it bin
better? Becauſe while they goe backe, it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth worſe with them then it
was before thy heard the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as Chriſt ſayth of the vncleane
ſpirit Matth. 12, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto himſelfe ſeuen other ſpirits
worſe them himſelfe, with which he commeth, and dwelleth in that man, out
of whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had gone, and ſo the end of that man is worſe then the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. After the ſame maner commeth it to paſſe with vs, and ſhal
hereafter alſo be vſuall: ſo alſo hath it fallen out with Rome. In the
time of the Martyrs ſhe was in her beſt flower, but afterward ſhe fell,
and abhomination was there erected, that Antichriſt might reigne there, yea
ſhe became ſuch a one, that worſe ſhe can not be. The grace of God,
which is reuealed and preached by the Goſpel, was hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that men might not
attaine vnto it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="430" facs="tcp:9413:224"/> it could not be but a great
and grieuous ſcourge and plague ſhould follow.</p>
            <p>So we alſo ſhall trie that great vengeance will come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs,
for that we do not beleeue nor obey the Goſpell, which we haue, and know. For
as often as God would ſend an horrible ſcourge and plague, he hath firſt
ſet vp a great light: As when he would ſend the Iewes out of their owne
countrie into captiuitie in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,<note place="margin">God vſeth lenity
before he executeth ſeueritie, &amp; firſt warneth before he
harmeth.</note> he firſt raiſed vp the godly King Hoſia, who ſhould
again reſtore the law, that the people might amend their life, but when they
did againe reuolt, God puniſhed them according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. So when he
mynded to deſtroy the Egyptians, he made a light to be ſet vp, and preached
vnto them by Moſes and Aaron: Moreouer when he would drowne all the world by
the flood, he ſent the Patriarch Noe, but when men did not amende, but
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came worſe and worſe, ſuch a ſore and grieuous plague did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Likewiſe the fiue cities Sodome and Gomorra togither with the reſt were
deſtroyed, for that they would not heare Lot, who feared God. Wherefore as
ſharpe vengeance ſhall light vpon them alſo, which heare the Goſpell,
but do not receiue it: euen as the ſeruaunt here in the Goſpell, is
deliuered to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentours till he ſhould pay all the dette: which is as
much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as, that he is compelled to ſuffer puniſhment for his
fault, and is neuer ſaued. For vnto ſynne is required death, and when he
dieth, he dieth alwayes, neither is there any helpe or deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance remaining.
Wherefore let vs receiue theſe thinges for our owne admonition: as for them
that will not heare, being harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and indurate, let them beware of the euell
that hangeth ouer them.</p>
            <p>This is a verie comfortable text, and ſweete to troubled
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, inaſmuch as it containeth in it meere forgeuenes of ſinnes:
Againe it ſetteth forth terrible iudgement to the vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; hard
hearted, eſpecially ſeeing that this ſeruaunt is not an Heathen, but had
heard the Goſpell, in that he had faith: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Lord tooke pittie
on him, and forgaue him his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, without doute he was a Chriſtian.
Wherefore this is not the puniſhment of Gentiles, nor of the common ſort
that heare not the Goſpell, but of them that with their eares heare the
Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and with their toung talke of it, but will not expreſſe it in
their life. We haue therefore the ſumme of this text. Whereas 
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:9413:224"/> the Scholemen diſpute here, whether ſynne commeth
againe, which was before remitted, I let it paſſe, for they are ignorant
what remiſſion of ſynnes is: they thinke it is a thing that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to
the hart, and lyeth quietly, when as notwithſtanding it is plainly the
kingdome of Chriſt, which endureth for euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſſing. For as the
ſunne neuertheles ſhineth, although I ſhut myne eyes: ſo this mercy
ſeat or forgiuenes of ſynne ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alwayes, albeit I fall. And as I
againe behold the ſunne when I open myne eyes: ſo I againe haue forgiuenes
of ſynnes, if I ryſe againe, and returne vnto Chriſt. Wherefore let no
man bring forgiuenes into ſuch a ſtraite, as theſe made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dreame

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Earely beloued, ye know that the Goſpell is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but
a treatiſe of the onely perſon, whoſe name is Chriſt. And albeit there
be extant many bookes &amp; ſundrie treatiſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning diuers men, as
well of the Gentiles as Chriſtians, yea and of the mother of God, S. Peter,
the Angels, and of many other Saincts beſyde: yet be they not Goſpels, but
that onely is the ſyncere Goſpell, which ſetteth forth Chriſt vnto vs,
and what good we muſt hope for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Sometime in the Goſpell there is
mention made of Iohn the Baptiſt, Marie, and the Apoſtles, howbeit this is
not properly the Goſpell, but therefore is it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them, that it might
be more perfectly declared, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Chriſt ſhould come, and what is his
office. So Luke deſcribeth the hiſtorie of Iohn the Baptiſt euen from the
beginning, what was done both in his conception and in his natiuitie, he
writeth alſo of the virgine Marie. All which thinges were committed to
writing not becauſe of their perſon, but becauſe of Chriſtes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
onely. In the Epiſtles of S. Paule there is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to memorie of
the Saincts, but all thinges ſound plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſt. For God hath ſo
ordained, that all men muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend <pb n="433" facs="tcp:9413:225"/> on that one man
Chriſt, muſt hope in him,<note place="margin">All that will be ſaued muſt
depend on Chriſt, &amp; put their hope and truſt in him.</note> muſt
repoſe their truſt in him, if they deſire to be ſaued, for he alone is
ſet forth of God to be a reconciliation for vs, as Paule ſayth Rom. 3.
Hitherto one hath cleaued to this ſainct, an other to that, one choſe to
himſelfe S. Marie, an other S. Barbarie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſectes and ſortes of
religion did flouriſh. But Chriſt was in no price, for his name onely
remained. We had many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, all which being neglected we ought to
haue cleaued onely to Chriſt. Hereupon S. Paule ſayth, that the Goſpell
was promiſed of God by the Prophetes concerning his ſonne. He reduceth and
bringeth it into ſuch a ſtreight, that in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell nothing is of any
importaunce which concerneth not Ieſus Chriſt. He that knoweth this, let
him giue thankes to God, that he knoweth where he may ſeeke for conſolation
and helpe, and in whom he may repoſe his truſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt in this dayes Goſpell is ſet forth vnto vs, that he
is conuerſaunt in the myddeſt of the people, and draweth all the world vnto
himſelfe with his gentlenes and ſweete doctrine, that they maye cleaue vnto
him in their heart, that they maye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to his goodnes, and
hope that they ſhall obtaine of him both ſpirituall and corporall good
thinges. Neither dothe he receiue any thinge of them, vpon whom he beſtoweth
benefites, nay he obtaineth nothing of them but ignominie and ſcorning, as is
declared in this text. A benefite proceedeth from him, for which he receiueth a
mocke and reproch.<note place="margin">Why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note>
Nowe the Goſpell is preached and offered to the whole world, that we may
learne to know this man well, and how we muſt be made Chriſtians, and not
how we muſt be made good. Other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes beſyde the Goſpell teach of
thoſe thinges, whereby men may be made good, as the writinges of the
Philoſophers and the rules of the ciuill lawe. The liues alſo of the
Saincts haue eſpeciall reſpecte vnto this, that men may imitate them. It
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the Goſpell to make good men, but to make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men.
For it is farre more excellent to be a Chriſtian, then an honeſt and good
man. A Chriſtian can ſay nothing of his owne goodnes or righteouſnes, for
he fyndeth in himſelfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge either good or righteous, but he muſt flie
to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes which is an others, and which commeth vnto him from an
other. Hereupon Chriſt is ſette forth vnto vs, as a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall 
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:9413:226"/> fountaine, which alwayes ouerfloweth with meere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and grace, for which he receiueth nothinge of vs, but that the godly do
acknowledge ſo great goodnes and grace, doe giue him thankes for the ſame,
doe prayſe and loue him, others in the meane ſeaſon mocking him, ſuch a
reward he receiueth of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Chriſtian whereof ſo
called.</note>Wherefore one is not therefore called a Chriſtian, for that he
worketh much, for there is an other thinge, which is cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely
for that he receiueth and draweth from Chriſt. If one receiueth nothing any
more of Chriſt, neither is he any more a Chriſtian, ſo that the name of a
Chriſtian commeth onely by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, and not by giuing or doing. If thou
thinke that becauſe of thy workes and deedes thou art a Chriſtian, thou
haſt euen then loſt the name of Chriſt. Good workes in deede are to be
done, counſell thereunto is to be giuen and receiued, but no man is therefore
called a Chriſtian, neither is any therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Wherefore if any
will more inwardly weye this name, in this reſpect onely a Chriſtian is to
be acknowledged, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he receiueth of Chriſt alone. Euen as one is
called white of the whitenes that is in him, blacke of the blacknes, great of
his ſtature: ſo a Chriſtian is called of Chriſt, whom he hath in
himſelfe, and of whom he receiueth that which is good. Now if one be named a
Chriſtian of Chriſt, he taketh not that name of his owne workes, whereupon
it plainly alſo foloweth, that no man is made a Chriſtian by workes. Which
if it be true, as it is true and certaine, it ſhall folow that Orders and
Sects doe nothinge pertaine to the name of Chriſt, neither doe make a
Chriſtian. Wherefore they which preach or teach in the Church, and ordaine
preceptes, workes, and decrees, are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, who albeit they pretend a
Chriſtian name, yet profite they nothinge, for vnder the colour of that name
they endeuour to burden and oppres vs with commaundements and workes. Of
workes, giuing thy ſelfe to faſting and prayers, thou mayeſt be called
abſtinent and temperat, but by no meanes a Chriſtian. For although thou
dideſt laye all thy workes togither, yea and ioynedſt the works of all
other to thine, yet neither ſo haſt thou Chriſt, neither art thou
therefore called a Chriſtian. Chriſt is a certaine other more excellent
thinge, then either the lawe or mans tradition. He is the ſonne of God, who
is ready to giue <pb n="435" facs="tcp:9413:226"/> onely, not to receiue: when as I am
ſuch a one that I do receiue of him, I haue him alſo, whom if I haue, I am
by good right called a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Goſpel preacheth Chriſt alſo to be the
greateſt and moſt highly exalted perſon in the world, not that he doth
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie men, but that he poureth forth all earthly and heauenly good thinges,
ſo that all men muſt truſt in him, muſt haue their hope repoſed in
him, and alwayes receiue onely of him. If any ſynne terrifie me in my
conſcience, and the preachers of the lawe endeuour to helpe me with their
workes, they ſhall preuaile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge with me. For then Chriſt alone can
helpe and none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde him, yea others make the caſe worſe, whether it be
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Paule, or the bleſſed virgine Marie her ſelfe the mother of
God. For Chriſt onely perfourmeth all thinges, who in his word, declareth
that if I beleeue, my ſynne is forgiuen me free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without all both worke
and merit, by pure grace through fayth in Chriſt. Which word when I ſhall
receiue, I receiue alſo comfort, that my ſynnes be forgiuen me as well
before God as before men, and I therefore giue thankes to God through Chriſt,
which giueth the holy Ghoſt and his grace vnto me, that ſinne may not hurt
me, neither here, nor in the laſt iudgement. If I feare death, and would not
die willingly, in this Chriſt I ſhall finde comfort and remedie, that I
ſhall not greatly paſſe for death. If becauſe of the wrath of God I be
afraid, he is my Mediator. And to be briefe, he that hath not this Chriſt,
the wrath of God alwaies remaineth ouer him, and in that ſtate he
ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he that deſireth to haue a glad conſcience,<note place="margin">A glad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience how it is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> which is not
afraid of ſinne, death, hell and the wrath of God, muſt take heede that he
repoſe his truſt in this Mediator Chriſt. For he is a fountaine abounding
with grace, which giueth both temporall and eternall life. Endeuour thou to
thinke and feele him euen in thy hart to be ſuch a one, then ſhalt thou
obtaine all thinges, for he aboundeth and ouerfloweth, neither can he but giue,
flowe, and abound, if that thou canſt beleeue. Then alſo ſhalt thou be a
right Chriſtian, howbeit by receiuing onely of Chriſt, and not by giuing.
It is a verie rich and precious word, which Paule prayſeth ſo greatly,
neither can he euer prayſe it ſufficiently, whereby God ſo gently
offereth his ſonne, that he maye poure <pb n="436" facs="tcp:9413:227"/> forthe his
grace vpon all, which doe not refuſe to receiue it. Hereupon it moreouer
foloweth: If ſoe be that a Chriſtian doeth good workes, whereby he
ſheweth loue to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he is not therefore made a Chriſtian or
righteous, but he muſt needes be a Chriſtian and righteous before. He doeth
good workes in deede, but they doe not make him a Chriſtian. The tree
bringeth forth and giueth fruite, and not the fruite the tree. Soe none is made
a Chriſtian by workes, but by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Hereof now ye may vnderſtand, what kynde of people Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
be, namely, that they be a company which cleaue vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſtians what they are.</note> and are of one ſpirit and
gifte with him. Hereupon it is that all Chriſtians are alike, neither hath
one more of Chriſt then an other. S. Peter is not better then the Theefe on
the croſſe: Marie the mother of God doth not excell Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len the
ſynnefull woman. There is in deede a difference in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thinges and
doinges, ſo the worke of the holy virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was greater, then the worke
of Marie Magdalen: Peter had a greater worke then the Theefe, if thou
conſider the works, but we are not therefore Chriſtians. The holy virgine
Marie is not a Chriſtian becauſe of her great worke, for that ſhe did
beare Chriſt ſo vnſpeakeable a treaſure in her wombe, as Chriſt
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaid to the woman, which cried vnto him from among the people,
Luke 11: <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes which thou
haſt ſucked: yea rather, ſayth he, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that heare the
worde of God and keepe it.</hi> In which place thou ſeeſt, that he
preferreth the faithfull euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his mother. For Chriſtians do therefore
beare their name, becauſe they beleeue in Chriſt. A virgine and a mother
are two notable names, howbeit they are nothinge being compared to the true
name of the faithfull. Wherefore we are all alike in Chriſt through faith,
albeit S. Peter haue a ſtronger faith then I, yet myne is as well fayth in
Chriſt as his. For the ſame Chriſt is offered of God the father vnto all
companies and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom he that hath obtained, hath him whole, whether he
be ſtrong or weake, for that ſkilleth not. The woman mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our
text, which was troubled ſo many yeares with her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, dothe receiue
and apprehend Chriſt as well as the virgine Marie his mother. Wherefore there
is one Chriſtian ſpirite, <pb n="437" facs="tcp:9413:227"/> one excelleth with an
other in the noblenes of byrth, S. Peter is enforced to call me his brother,
and I againe deare be bolde to call him my brother. Yea Chriſt himſelfe is
touched with care of vs, and counteth vs for his brethren, as he ſaide after
his reſurrection to Marie Magdalen, Ioh. 20: <hi>I aſcende vnto my Father
and to your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi> And S. Paule calleth
Chriſt the firſt borne among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Whereof alſo he writeth
excellently in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, where entreating of
falſe brethren he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.9.</note>
               <hi>Take heede leſt by any meanes this power of yours be an occaſion of

knowledge, ſitte at table in the idols temple, shall not the conſcience of
him which is weake, be boldened to eate thoſe thinges which are ſacrificed
to idols? and ſo through thy knowledge shall the weake brother perish, for
whom Chriſt died. Now when ye ſinne ſo againſt your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and
wounde their weake conſcience, ye ſinne againſt Chriſt.</hi> Here thou
ſeeſt, if a Chriſtian be offended, or euell be done vnto him, the ſame
is done vnto Chriſt. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the ſumme of the whole
Goſpell,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> that we maye

               </gap>, but that we maye knowe that all
that we haue, we haue it from him. If we be Chriſtians, we haue all thinges,
then God is our father, and we are Lordes of all both heauenly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinges, which is gotten of vs by no worke be it neuer ſoe great.</p>
            <p>Thou ſeeſt nowe how farre they be from the name of Chriſt,
which be vnder the kingdom of the Pope. They that will preach the Goſpell
muſt preach nothing els, beſyde the onely perſon, which is Chriſt, not
Marie, ſo farre muſt they be from preaching the Pope or any worke albeit
precious, they muſt preach &amp; offer Chriſt onely vnto vs, &amp; none

in the laſt day) and how that good workes are to be done of thee, for which
thou mayſt be rewarded of him, &amp; thou ſhalt ſo receiue it, ſurely

be ſo ſet forth vnto thee, as he was wont to be painted, that his mother
ſheweth him her pappes, that is properly to preach Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and not Chriſt,
who giueth onely, and receiueth not. This is <pb n="438" facs="tcp:9413:228"/> certaine,
when thou ſhalt haue receiued of him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good workes do flow forth of their
owne accord, being not compelled, as is ſet forth in this dayes Goſpell:
wherein moreouer is declared that Chriſt preacheth the Goſpell to the
people: now it is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worke to preach. For it is a great benefit vnto
vs, that he is become our maiſter and inſtructer, that he teacheth vs by
what meanes we may come to the knowledge of him, this is a parte of his great
goodnes and grace. For as long as he was here in the earth, he ceſſed not
to teach, that we might alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether receiue him for the Meſſias and
Sauiour: and by his workes alſo did helpe and relieue euerie one, when the
caſe ſo required.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes of
Chriſt.</note>Thou fyndeſt no man in the Goſpell, to whom helpe was
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, or which at any time aſked any thinge of the Lord, which was not
giuen him. For how many ſoeuer went vnto him, that were blynde, deafe, lame,
ſicke of the palſey, had the dropſie, he receiued all, and helped them
all according to their deſire, and healed them of all kindes of
diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Luke 6.19.</note> as Luke ſayth: All the
whole multitude ſought to touch him, for there went vertue out of him, and
healed them all. So doeth he alſo to this woman. The woman heareth him
preaching, and perceiueth him to be a bountifull and gracious man, which
ſheweth himſelfe gentle to the whole world, whereupon ſhe hath an
affection both to loue him, and to cleaue vnto him. For ſhe maketh accompt,
foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he putteth awaye none from him, that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie her
his goodnes, wherefore leauing all the Apoſtles, ſhe caſteth both her
hearte and confidence vpon Chriſt alone, and thinketh thus with her ſelfe:
If I may touch but the hemme of his garment, I ſhalbe whole. She thought no
other thinge in her heart, but, certainly he will helpe me, if ſo be that I
ſhall touch his garment with myne hand, yet hath ſhe not ſo good a
corage, that ſhe dare come before his face, ſhe iudged her ſelfe more
vnworthie, then that ſhe might either talke with him, or looke vpon him, for
ſhe knew that ſhe had deſerued nothing, and that ſhe had beſtowed no
good thinge vpon the Lord, hereupon it is that ſhe ſo behaueth her ſelfe,
ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth behynde his backe, ſhe falleth downe at his feete, and toucheth
onely the hemme of his garment. In a ſumme, here is nothing but meere
baſhfulnes and want of merit: here is no preparation, here is no worke, 
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:9413:228"/> and yet the miſerable woman promiſeth her ſelfe
much goodnes from the Lord, namely that he would heale her. She had bin
diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood twelue whole yeares, what could ſhe
merite thereby? how could ſhe therefore be worthy of any thinge?
Neuertheleſſe being vnworthie, and hauing merited nothing, ſhe
notwithſtanding looketh for helpe of Chriſt, feeling her ſelfe to haue
great neede thereof. And this is a true prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, both to the grace and
goodnes of Chriſt, when I feele my ſelfe to ſtand in neede thereof, and
then doth it verie well fall out, when theſe two come togither, the rich and
the poore, Chriſt and the ſynner. But it is no ſmall matter for men to be
perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they are poore, and ſtand in neede of grace. For that
commeth to paſſe verie hardly, Satan alſo doth not ſuffer it, but
alwayes draweth men backe to workes, that they may not come ſo farre, as to
thinke that they haue neede either of the grace or mercy of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The text affirmeth that the woman was diſeaſed with an
iſſue of blood twelue whole yeares,<note place="margin">The woman
diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood.</note> and had ſpent all her
ſubſtaunce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> phiſitians, and that the more medicines ſhe tooke, the
worſe alwayes ſhe was. Luke and Marke do not a litle exaggerate and
amplifie it, whereby they both ſignifie, that the more workes be preached,
ſo much the worſe is it with vs, and that there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nothing vnto vs
thereby, but a continuall multiplying of our euell. Our conſcience can not be
quieted with workes, for albeit ſome ſynne be driuen out of the
conſcience, forthwith there is an other, yea the remedy and work oftentimes
do make ſynne in vs, where there is no ſynne, vntill ſuche time as we
come to Chriſt, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this woman, which had bin ſick ſo
long, neither had ſhe bin euer helped, if ſhe had not come to Chriſt, of
whom ſhe obtaineth helth without any workes, giuing him nothing, but
receiueth onely of him,<note place="margin">Continuall preaching of the word of
God verie neceſſarie.</note> and ſuffreth to be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. Nowe
here is alſo declared, how the worde of God is dayly to be handled, and
without ceaſſing to be vrged, for there are as yet alwayes found ſuch
men, as haue verie troubled and afflicted conſciences. For this woman is a
type or figure of all men, which are diſeaſed with an iſſue, that is,
which feele there ſynnes, the iſſue whereof doeth alwayes runne, neither
can it be ſtayed, for fleſh and blood doeth no otherwiſe, then it is
caried with it owne luſt and deſire. Nowe if that feeling of ſynne be 
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:9413:229"/> great, thoſe wretches come forth and endeuour to helpe
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, then one taketh this worke in hand, an other that, and yet
preuaile they nothing from hence ſo many orders, ſo many monaſteries haue
ſprong, hereupon ſo many and ſo great works haue bin inuented, that they
are almoſt without number. What was the cauſe of all theſe? ſurely euen
the ſynnefull conſcience. For we haue thought to ſaue our ſoules by
theſe, and to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered wholy from all ſynnes. But Chriſt was not
there preſent, for we would giue and not receiue. Wherefore our caſe became
alwayes worſe, as it fell out alſo with this woman, who if ſhe had tried
the helpe of all Phiſitians, neither yet ſo could ſhe fynde, whereby
ſhe might be holpen. So we alſo beleeued all Phiſitians, for whatſoeuer
euerie one brought, that we by and by receiued. And was it any meruell? for we
deſired to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and to haue a glad conſcience. The Phiſitians are
the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Lawe: nowe if any deſired to be deliuered from
ſynnes, what did they vnto him? they gaue him, whereby he became onely weaker
and feebler, which ſurely we haue ſeene and felt to our great euell,
namely, how they would haue men to be iuſtified by workes, &amp; by them to
be deliuered from ſynnes. But it profited nothinge, for we were alwayes made
more weake againſt ſynne and death, ſo that there is neuer found in the
earth a more deſperate ſorte of people, then Sacrifycing Prieſtes, Monkes
and Veſtall virgines, and they whatſoeuer they by that truſt in workes:
if there did but a litle byle ariſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, byandby they muſt runne to
the Poticarie, then is ſuche tryinge of medecine, ſuche running and haſt,
as though they had nowe breathed their laſt. Neither is any ſo afrayd of
the laſt iudgement as this people. Which then they verie well ſhew, when
they ſo deale with workes, that they reſt onely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, neither doe
perſeruer conſtant in any worke, and the more workes they doe, ſo much
worſe is their caſe, ſo much more are they caſt downe in mynde and
become more deſperate, ſo that it falleth out with them as with this
woman.</p>
            <p>It is a verie goodly ſimilitude, which may moſt fitly be
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to vs: for we do not onely beſtow temporall thinges, but our body
alſo by faſting, chaſtiſing, and bearing other hard and intolerable
burdens, ſo that ſome haue thereby become mad, and deſtitute of all
ſtrength, yea &amp; at the laſt loſt their life. And I my 
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:9413:229"/> ſelfe haue bene ſuch a one, and haue without dout
more reſorted to medicines then many other. I could not atteine ſo farre,
as to leaue the Popes law. It ſeemed a hard and a ſore matter vnto me to
eate fleſh on the friday, O good God,<note place="margin">A hard thing to
forſake pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſtrie being once entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</note> how hard a
thing was it to me, before I durſt attempt to doe that? Wherefore if any will
be deliuered from ſuch thinges, and contemne the traditions of the Pope,
truely he muſt haue a ſtronge foundation of faith, which if he ſhall not
haue, let him looke about him againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before he attempt it. For if
faith be wanting, it will fal out with vs as with this woman, who had ſpent
all her ſubſtance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Phiſitians, amending nothing, but rather waxing
worſe and worſe: In like maner all our workes, labours &amp; endeuours
ſhall be loſt, all our obedience, with all orders or religions, and
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we haue beſtowed therein ſhall be in vaine. Howbeit if we
haue faith, we ſhall at the laſt ſee the decrees of the Pope and
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Biſhops to be nothing, becauſe of which before we trembled and
were troubled, all which did helpe vs ſo much, as the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians did that
good woman, which had beſtowed all her ſubſtance and riches, yea and her
body alſo, that ſhe might be healed. How many kindes of medicines and
ſyrrups thinkeſt thou did that woman vſe? how weake, feeble, &amp;
ſicke was ſhe oftentimes made with them? yea if ſhe might haue bene
healed, it may ſeeme ſhe would haue taken any medicine, howbeit it profited
her nothing, ſhe was afflicted with her diſeaſe the ſpace of twelue
yeares. How therefore is this miſerable woman at the laſt helped? When
ſhe did light vpon a man whoſe name is Chriſt, and put her hope and
truſt in him, ſhe was healed. But who led her to that man? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dout
not the Phiſitians. For if our Preachers ſhould preach Chriſt, the
marchandize of the Pope togither with his decrees would be nothing ſet by,
but rather ſhe heard it of ſome that was alſo reſtored to health, who
told her without douting, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

gentle and good man, which helpeth euery one, and ſendeth away none from him
whom he helpeth not, and therfore is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dout ſent of God, that he may
helpe all. Which the woman hauing heard, ſhe leaueth the Phiſitians, and
maketh haſt vnto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So alſo at this day it falleth

this man, which is Chriſt, ſaying to the Pope: if I muſt receiue onely of
Chriſt, how vnwiſely haue I delt, that I haue turned ſo much vnto thee?
farewel therfore O Pope, farewell ye beloued Biſhops, I neede no more your
medicine, workes and merits, precepts and lawes, ye haue grieued me long enough
with them, I haue gotten one, which beſtoweth vpon me freely, whatſoeuer I
payed full deare for vnto you before: he giueth that vnto me without workes and
merits, for which I was faine before to beſtow my body, ſtrength and helth,
and yet could not obtaine it. Fare ye well, I minde to come no more to you
hereafter. Chriſtians therefore are made, not by the decrees of the Pope, not

            <p>The other Euangeliſts write concerning this woman, that 
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:9413:230"/> after ſhe was healed, Chriſt perceiued vertue to
haue gone out of him, and turned him about in the preaſe, and aſked who had
tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him, and that his Diſciples made aunſwere, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude did
throng &amp; thruſt him, but that the Lord would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that
aunſwere, but ſayd: ſome one hath touched me: for I perceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue
is gone out of me, I know that ſome one hath receiued ſome thing from me.
All which the Lorde therefore did, that the faith of the woman might be
thankefull vnto him, which he would therefore haue made manifeſt before all
the people, for that nothing is more acceptable vnto him, then that we beleeue
and truſt in him &amp; alſo that the Lorde might by this miracle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the faith of the Ruler. Wherefore Marke ſayth, that when the woman
vnderſtood that the Lord knew of her, ſhe feared and trembled, and came and
fell downe before him, and tolde him the whole truth, how it fell out with her:
whereupon the Lord doth deliuer her and ſayth: <hi>Goe in peace, &amp; be
whole of thy diſeaſe.</hi> Were not theſe louing wordes? what great ioy
did the woman take here, when as Chriſt had delt ſo bountifully with
her?<note place="margin">The frute of true hope in Chriſt.</note> This ioy and
peace all they obtaine, which repoſe their whole hope and truſt in Chriſt
Ieſus. Where this ioy ſhall be, forthwith workes muſt needes follow,
which may ſhewe forth this ioy: as alſo the faith of this woman muſt
needes come to light. For as ſoone as ſhe had receiued of the Lord, ſhe
confeſſed before all the people, neither was ſhe aſhamed to declare,
that ſhe had receiued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him, for which notwithſtanding ſhe
had giuen nothing. Now, God requireth of vs theſe works &amp; this giuing of
thanks, to wit, that we confes &amp; declare before all men ſuch good things,
grace and benefites, that others alſo may be brought vnto him, &amp; ſuffer
a benefite to be beſtowed vpon them, as it was here done. Wherefore
Chriſtian life enforceth me to doe good vnto others alſo, euen as God
through Chriſt hath done good vnto me, but thereby am I not made a
Chriſtian, as the woman here is not healed by her confeſſion, for ſhe
was healed before any work and confeſſion, but after ſhe had recouered
her health, ſhe confeſſeth Chriſt, and prayſeth him, euen to the
commoditie and conuerting of others. We alſo inaſmuch as we are
Chriſtians, doe ſo liue, that one helpeth and pleaſureth an other in what
thing ſoeuer he is at any time able. And as this woman was healed before all
works, ſo we muſt be made Chriſtians before we doe any worke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="444" facs="tcp:9413:231"/>As the Goſpell is ſet before our eyes in
this woman: ſo is it alſo ſet forth in the Daughter of this Ruler. This
chiefe ruler of the Sinagogue, whom Marke calleth Iairus, had a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g faith
and confidence, that Chriſt would raiſe vp his Daughter. For vnles he had
bene of that minde concerning Chriſt, he had not come vnto him, neither had
deſired ſuch a thing of him which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the power &amp; ſtrength of
nature. Wherefore by this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he ſhewed his faith, which faith being
perceiued, the Lorde could not but graunt his deſire, wherefore riſing
forthwith, he went with him, &amp; in this going this hiſtorie of the woman
came to paſſe, which had bene diſeaſed of an iſſue of blood twelue
yeares, as we haue now hearde. When therefore the Lorde was entred into the
Rulers houſe, he ſawe the minſtrells and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude making noyſe,
which were there according to the lawe of Moſes, and did ſounde the trumpet
and pipes as in our cuntrie they ringe the bells to gather the people togither.
But he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the multitude to go forth, ſaying: <hi>The child is not
dead but ſleepeth.</hi> And they laught him to ſcorne and mocked him. Which
giueth vs to vnderſtand,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell is
contemned and counted fooliſhnes, of the world</note> that when it is
preached, that Chriſt is he which ſaueth, that our works preuaile nothing,
then the world can not conteine it ſelfe, but that it ſcorneth &amp;
mocketh, for it can not be perſuaded, that Chriſt doth helpe and ſuccour,
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as this people without all dout ſayd after this ſort: Beholde what an
excellent Maiſter and a goodly Phiſitian he is, what could he haue holpen,
which knoweth not yet, what it is to ſleepe, and what to be dead? This title
muſt needes remayne to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell in the world, that the preaching
thereof is counted fooliſh and contemptible. For Satan can not abide, that
honour ſhould be giuen to this Goſpel before the world, for it bringeth but
ſmal commoditie to his kingdom, which foraſmuch as he perceiueth full well,
he practizeth all craftes and wiles, that he may either altogither hinder it,
or at the leaſt make it to preuaile litle with them that be his, whoſe
hartes he hath wholy blinded and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the light of the
glorious Goſpell of Chriſt ſhoulde not ſhine vnto them, as S. Paule
ſayth 2. Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>Neither yet can it be, that this preaching of Chriſt ſhould
not be frutefull, foraſmuch as it is not vttered in vaine: for albeit it be
receiued but of a few, that doth not greatly ſkill. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Satan
perceiueth any thing to be taken from him, and that <pb n="445" facs="tcp:9413:231"/> that
preaching is ordained plainly againſt his kingdom,<note place="margin">Satan a
moſt grieuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to the preaching of the Goſpell.</note> he doth
without delay purſue it, contemne it, and aſſaile it on euery ſide,
that euen now he is fierce and rageth in the whole world. For the Goſpell of
Chriſt ouerthroweth whatſoeuer the world and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan delight in, and
whatſoeuer to the worlde ſeemeth moſt holy &amp; goodly. For the worlde
imagineth to it ſelfe ſuch a God, as hath regard to our good workes, and
will be pleaſed with the erecting of Maſſes and vigiles for them that are
departed, with Roſaries as they call them, habit, ſhauing, and whatſoeuer
other trifles are vſed in the Papacie. Now if there come any which bringeth
the Goſpell, and inueyeth againſt theſe vaine toyes of the Pope, and
ſayth that they are nothing worth, but are meere deluſions, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as
they are repugnant to Chriſt and the Scripture, he is counted a moſt wicked
felow, and therefore muſt be puniſhed, he is reproued as an heretike and a
ſeducer of the people: ſo that they burſt forth into great wordes and
ſay: wilt thou gouerne all the whole world? dooſt thou thinke thy ſelfe
the wiſeſt man that is? and were our forefathers fooliſh and without all
vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? many holy men haue done theſe workes, and haue preached of
them, and wilt thou come, and turne them all to nothing? thou ſhalt not doe
it. Then rage and furie beginneth, yea perſecution, ſlaying and murdering,
and the Deuill will ſeeme to haue a iuſt cauſe, howſoeuer the matter
goeth. Thus much ſhall ſuffize at this time concerning this text. Now ye
muſt take eſpecial heede, that out of the Goſpells ye learne throughly,
how all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the onely perſon, whoſe name is Chriſt,
and lay vp this in the depth of your hart, that a Chriſtian hath his name of
Chriſt. For I know how much it auaileth both in tentation and in
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie to hold that faſt. Let vs now by prayer call for the grace of
God, that at the laſt we may with moſt earneſt zeale and harty affection
embrace true Chriſtianitie, Amen. *** *</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know nothing more certaine concerning S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, then that
which this Goſpell mentioneth of him. Other things which are written of him
in the booke of Legends, are moſt impudent lyes. And albeit they were partly
true, yet haue they no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, neither make vs any thing the better.
Wherfore we will leaue them vntouched, &amp; ſpeake ſomething of this
Goſpel, which ſhal be more profitable &amp; neceſſary for vs then all
thoſe Legends. The former part of this Goſpell fell out about the euentyde
of the Paſſeouer, when two had returned from Emmaus, &amp; ſhewed vnto
the other Diſciples, that the Lorde was riſen againe. The latter part fell
out the eight day after the Paſſeouer. It is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous how comfortable
this Goſpell is, ſhewing vnto you, the frutes of faith, namely peace, and
ioye, as Paule ſayth Rom. 5: being iuſtified therefore by faith, we haue
peace toward God, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But now we will entreat in
few wordes, what this is that the Lord ſheweth to his Diſciples his handes
and his feete, whereby is declared vnto vs, what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie 
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:9413:233"/> we haue by Chriſt, whereunto he profiteth vs, and what
we muſt loke for of him. It is engraffed in the harts of all men as it were
by nature, to haue a certen wil to be honeſt &amp; godly, &amp; euery one
thinketh how he may come to ſaluation, wherby it hath come to paſſe, that
one hath inuented this thing, an other that, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſuaded, that
thereby he ſhould make God fauourable vnto him, and obtaine heauen, but none
ſuch at any time hath ſtoode in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right way, foraſmuch as all haue had
this drift, that they might procure Gods fauour by deedes and good workes.
Notable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors alſo and holy fathers haue written &amp; taught many things,
how we might attaine vnto godlines. About this they haue miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably troubled
them ſelues, but as we ſee, and to our notable loſſe haue felt, they
haue done litle. Wherefore it is exceeding neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that ſome ſound
knowledge be had hereof, wherby we muſt endeuour to true godlines,
foraſmuch as it is a thing of no ſmall importance. For he that is deceiued
here, lozeth the ſumme and chiefe point of all Chriſtianitie: hereof
therefore we muſt nowe ſpeake ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">True righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained, not by our
owne workes, but by the works which Chriſt hath wrought for vs.</note>True
&amp; ſound righteouſnes conſiſteth not in our owne works, but in the
works of an other. Take an example hereof: One buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth temples, an other for
religions ſake goeth to S. Iames, to Aquiſgrane, to Rome, to the holy
ſepulcher, the third pineth him ſelfe with faſtings, prayeth, weareth a
cowle, goeth bare foote, or worketh ſome other ſuch worke whatſoeuer it
be, theſe are our owne workes. God hath not commaunded them, but men and
hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, iuſtifiers of them ſelues haue inuented them, and haue thought
that they are precious good workes, and greatly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of God, ſweetely
perſuading them ſelues, that they are by them deliuered from ſinnes, and
that God is pacified towards them. But theſe workes choſen of their owne
proper will, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth at all, neither can ſtand, foraſmuch as
they proceede not of faith, yea they are ſinnes, as Sainct Paule ſaith Rom.
14: <hi>VVhatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi> Theſe our works
therefore are defiled and vncleane in the ſight of God, yea he doth abhorre
and loathe them. Wherefore if we will haue to doe with God, we muſt not
aſcend truſting to our owne workes, but to the workes of an other. But
which are thoſe workes of an other, that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of God? Truely the
workes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whom God the father ſent downe from
heauen, that by his death <pb n="449" facs="tcp:9413:233"/> and paſſion he might
ſatisfie for our ſinnes. This ſatisfaction fel out vpon this occaſion:
We were ſubiect to great daunger,<note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe
wherein man was before he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by Chriſt.</note> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous tyrannes
had power ouer vs, which day and night without ceaſing did vexe vs. The law
which God gaue vnto man, did vrge vs, and required many thinges of vs, which we
were not able to performe, and therefore it condemned vs. Sinne alſo did lye
vpon vs as a heauy burden which the lawe did oft times make greater &amp;
greater. Death went about to deuour vs, inaſmuch as it is the wages of
ſinne, Satan alſo endeuoured to throw vs downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to hell,
inaſmuch as he would puniſh vs for our ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: all thinges
were full of trembling and anguiſh.</p>
               <p>God taking pitie vpon this ſo great calamity, ſent his only
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne, and that of his mere grace &amp; goodnes, without our
deſert, that he might deliuer vs out of ſo great tyrannie, which he
mightely did after this ſorte: He ſatisfied the law,<note place="margin">Chriſt hath fulfilled the law, preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt ſinne
ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death and vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Satan.</note> and fulfilled it perfectly. For
he loued God with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, &amp; with all his
ſtrength: he loued his neighbour alſo as him ſelfe, in theſe the whole
law and the Prophetes do conſiſt. Nowe whatſoeuer Chriſt did, it
conſiſted in theſe two. He loued God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he obeyed his will,
he tooke vpon him the nature of man, and performed in all obedience thoſe
thinges that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned him of the father, as Paul ſaith Phil. 2: <hi>He
became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the father vnto the death, euen the death of the
croſſe.</hi> Secondly, he loued his neighbour: for all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes which he
did in the earth, tended vnto this end, that he might therby profit his
neighbour, and therefore he ſo loued his neighbour, that he euen died for
him, as he ſaith himſelfe to his diſciples Ioh. 15: <hi>Greater loue then
this hath no man, when any man beſtoweth his life for his frends:</hi> S.
Paul doth more ſet forth this, ſaying, for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when he writeth
thus Rom. 5: <hi>But God ſetteth out his loue towards vs, ſeeing that while
we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for vs.</hi> Foraſmuch then as Chriſt
hath ſo fulfilled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, it could not accuſe him, neither was ſinne of
any force with him. He ſet vpon it, and did preuaile ouer it, and ſwallowed
it vp, it was enforced to be extinguiſhed of him, no otherwiſe then a
ſparke of fire in the moſt wide ſea. For in him was nothing but mere
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Death alſo came, and went about to deuour him, it deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him in deede, but it could not digeſt him, it was enforced to yeeld him vp
againe, yea and this deuouring was an vtter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie 
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:9413:234"/> to death, for the caſe being quite altered, Chriſt
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured death it ſelfe. For it had ſet vpon him, againſt whome it had
no right, foraſmuch as not a whit of ſinne did appeare in him. Where
ſinne is not, there death hath nothing to doe, as Sainct Paule ſayth 1.
Cor. 15: <hi>The ſtinge of death is ſinne,</hi> with this it killeth,
otherwiſe it ſhould be dull, and haue no ſtrength. Satan alſo made a
triall of his ſtrength in him, but in vaine, and to his owne griefe, for he
layde handes on him, with whome he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe. The wretch was ouercome
in this conflict, and went away with ſhame, as Chriſt ſayth, Ioh. 14:
<hi>The Prince of this world commeth, and hath nought in me.</hi> Hell alſo
did open his mouth, and would haue deuoured Chriſt, but contrariwiſe it was
deuoured of him. And ſo in this conflict the Law, Sinne, Death, Satan and
hell were vanquiſhed, ouer all which he triumphed &amp; gloried with great
pompe, as Paule ſayth Col. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers by faith enioy the workes of
Chriſt as their owne.</note>All theſe thinges were not onely done for our
commoditie, but alſo if we beleeue in this Lorde Chriſt, they are giuen
vnto vs. For whatſoeuer he hath, it ſerueth for vs, yea he him ſelfe is
ours, as Paule ſayth Rom. 8. <hi>God ſpared not his owne ſonne, but gaue
him for vs all to death, how shall he not with him giue vs all thinges
alſo?</hi> So that I may boldly glorie of all victorie, which he obtained
ouer the law, ſinne, death, the deuill, and may chalenge to my ſelfe all
his workes, euen as if they were myne owne, and I my ſelfe had done them,
ſo that I beleeue in Chriſt. Otherwiſe his workes ſhall profitte me
nothinge at all, if they were not giuen vnto me. Theſe are the workes of an
other which doe commende vs before God, and ſaue vs. Our owne workes ſhall
doe nothing, we are weaker, then that we can reſiſt euen the leaſt
ſinne, ſo farre is it of that we are able to encounter with death,<note place="margin">How a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him ſelf againſt the
law, ſinne, death, Satan.</note> Satan, and hell. Wherefore when the Lawe
ſhall come, and accuſe thee, that thou dooſt not obſerue it, ſende it
vnto Chriſt, and ſay: There is that man which hath fulfilled the lawe, to
him I cleaue, he hath fulfilled it for me, and hath giuen his fullfilling vnto
me: when it heareth theſe thinges, it will be quiet. If ſinne come, and
woulde haue thee by the throte, ſende it vnto Chriſt, and ſaye: As much
as thou mayſt doe agaynſt him, ſo much right ſhalt thou haue agaynſt
me: for I am in him, and he is in me. If death creepe vppon thee, and attempt
to deuoure thee, ſaye vnto it: Good Maiſtres <pb n="451" facs="tcp:9413:234"/> death,
dooſt thou knowe this man? come and byte out his tooth, haſt thou forgotten
howe litle thy byting preuayled with him once? goe too if it be a pleaſure
vnto thee, encounter with him agayne. Thou hadſt perſuaded thy ſelfe,
that thou ſhouldeſt haue preuayled ſomewhat agaynſt him, when he did
hange betwene two theeues, &amp; dyed an ignominious death, which was counted
curſed both before God and the worlde. But what didſt thou gayne thereby?
Thou didſt byte in deede, but it turned worſt to thy ſelfe. I pertaine to
this man, I am his, and he is myne, and where he abydeth, there alſo will I
abyde. Thou couldeſt hurte him nothinge, wherefore alſo let me alone. After
the ſame ſorte if the Deuill, if hell come violently vppon thee, and
trouble thee, ſende them vnto Chriſt, and thou ſhalt eaſily make them
to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>And thus ye ſee what Chriſt is vnto vs,<note place="margin">The ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie which the faithfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy through
Chriſt.</note> namely ſuch a man as is giuen vnto vs of God, that he might
extinguiſh ſinnes, vanquiſh death, deſtroy hell, ouercome the Deuill,
and all theſe for our commoditie. If he had not done this, nor giuen vnto vs
theſe thinges, we had bene for euer vnder the curſe of the law, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſinne, vnder death, vnder the deuill, and vnder hell. God hath deliuered vs
from theſe by that Chriſt. Wherefore S. Paul ſaith out of the Prophet
Oſee 1. Cor. 15: <hi>Death is ſwalowed vp into victorie. O death where is
thy ſtinge? O hell where is thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? The ſtinge of death is ſinne,
and the ſtrength of ſinne is the law. But thankes be vnto God, which hath
giuen vs victorie through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We
are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God by no workes or merits of our owne, but onely by
the workes of Chriſt.</note> Hereof we may eaſily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what kinde
of workes thoſe be, which doe make vs entire and righteous before God. Surely
they are the workes of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not our owne workes choſen of our
ſelues. Wherefore the whole Papacie falleth here, with all the moſt
precious and holy workes thereof, which hath this drift onely, that
miſerable, wretched, and blinded men may be perſuaded, that they obtayne
heauen by their merits, and their owne workes. Hereuppon haue ſpronge ſo
many orders, that they can not almoſt be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, of which one ſtriued to
be holier then an other, according as they exerciſed harder, greater, and
weightier workes. But this their miſerable labour, anguiſh, prayers,
faſtinges, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the body, and ſuch like, were vaine workes,
and of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at all, neither had they ſo much power, that they were able 
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:9413:235"/> to take away ſo much as euen the leaſt ſinne,
which they call ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. They were altogither vnmindfull of this ſaying
Eſay 29, which the Lord repeteth Matth. 15: <hi>This people dravveth nere
vnto me vvith their mouth, &amp; honoureth me vvith their lippes, but their
heart is farre of from me. But in vaine they vvorshippe me, teaching ſuch
doctrines, as are nothing els but the precepts of men.</hi> Hereupon now thou
maiſt gather with thy ſelfe, that all holy men, although they be exceeding
holy, yet do obtaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by their owne holines, merites or
workes. And not ſo much as Mary her ſelfe the mother of God, was made
righteous &amp; holy in reſpect of her virginitie, or in that ſhe was the
mother of God, but ſaluation hath come vnto all by Ieſus Chriſt, as by
the workes of an other. Wherfore this is diligently to be noted, that our
felicitie doth not conſiſt in our owne workes, but in the workes of an
other, namely of Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, which we obtaine through only
faith in him.</p>
               <p>This alſo the hiſtorie of this Goſpell ſeemeth to
ſignifie, when as the Lorde ſheweth to his diſciples, but ſpecially to
Thomas, his handes &amp; feete. By which deede he declareth, that it was
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that thoſe handes and feete ſhould do theſe things, &amp;
that no other works, that is, their owne, &amp; not the workes of an other, do
pertaine vnto ſaluation.<note place="margin">Handes and feete what they
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in the Scripture.</note> For in the Scriptures by handes
and feete workes &amp; conuerſation are ſignified. Theſe hands and feete
Chriſt doth as yet eftſoones ſhew to vs &amp; ſay: Behold, I am that
onely man, whoſe workes &amp; conuerſation are of force with God, thou
ſhalt labour in vaine with thine owne workes, thine owne righteouſnes
maketh nothing hereunto, it hath an other end. If thou be righteous, it is
profitable to thee among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, here in eart thou haſt the glory &amp; praiſe
thereof, as Paul ſayth Rom. 4. But before God this thy righteouſnes is of
no eſtimation, thou muſt ſet in place thereof an other, namely mine, this
God my father doth allow. For I haue deliuered thee from ſinnes, death, the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, hell, &amp; from all euell, thou ſhouldeſt neuer haue eſcaped
out of theſe by thine owne power, but hadſt lyen as yet moſt deepely
drowned in them. I haue appeaſed the wrath of God, and of an angrie iudge,
haue made him, a gentle, mercifull and gracious father, beleeue this and it
goeth well with thee, thou art then ſafe, entire, and righteous. Beware that
thou preſume not to deale before God with thine owne works, but if thou wilt
do any <pb n="453" facs="tcp:9413:235"/> thing with him, creepe into me, put on me, and
thou ſhalt obtaine of my Father, whatſoeuer thou deſireſt and
aſkeſt, as he him ſelfe ſayth vnto his Diſciples Ioh. 16: <hi>Verely,
verely I ſay vnto you, whatſoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my name, he
will giue it you.</hi> Wherefore as from the beginning ſinne which was an
others, hath bene deriued vnto vs from Adam, for neither I, nor thou haue eate
of the apple: ſo alſo by the righteouſnes of an other we muſt be
reſtored vnto righteouſnes and integrity. This other is Chriſt Ieſus,
by whoſe righteouſnes and works we are all ſaued, as I haue nowe
ſufficiently declared. This S. Paule hath very pithily comprehended euen in
one ſentence, where 1. Cor. 1. he ſayth thus: <hi>Chriſt Ieſus is made
vnto vs of God, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, &amp;
redemption, that, according as it is written, he that reioyceth, let him
reioyce in the Lord.</hi> And Rom. 4. he ſayth: <hi>Ieſus Chriſt was
deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our
iuſtification.</hi> In theſe two litle ſentences are briefly compriſed,
and ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whatſoeuer thinges we muſt looke for from
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Howbeit all theſe thinges are enioyed by faith, for he that is
without faith, to him they are vnpoſſible to be comprehended,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſt is cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the
vnbeleeuers, but of the faithfull the power and wiſedom of God.</note> yea
they are counted fooliſhnes to reaſon &amp; to the world, as Paul ſayth
1. Cor 1: <hi>Chriſt vnto the Iewes is euen a ſtumbling block, and vnto the
Grecians, foolishnes,</hi> that is, when Chriſt is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that he is our
righteouſnes, that ſaluation commeth vnto vs by him, and that by him we are
made the children of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, without our owne workes and
righteouſnes, then thoſe holy men, and iuſtifiers of them ſelues are
offended, no otherwiſe then the Iewes. Moreouer to the prudent and wiſe men
of this world, it ſeemeth fooliſhnes and a certaine ridiculous thing, that
a man being faſtned to the croſſe and put to death, doth performe theſe
thinges. Whatſoeuer therefore is counted righteous, holy, wiſe and prudent
in the eyes of the world, it is offended and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at this Chriſt.
But, ſaith Paul moreouer, <hi>Vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are called, both of the Iewes
&amp; Grecians, we preach Chriſt, the power of God, and the wiſedom of
God.</hi> He ſayth alſo Rom. 1. <hi>The Goſpell of Chriſt is the power
of God vnto ſaluation to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that beleeueth, to the Iew firſt and
alſo to the Grecian. For by it the righteouſnes of God is reuealed from
faith to faith, as it is written Haba. 2: The iuſt shall liue by faith.</hi>
Wherefore <pb n="454" facs="tcp:9413:236"/> the Lord ſayth very well to the Diſciples
of Iohn: <hi>Bleſſed is he that shall not be offended in me.</hi> So thou
ſeeſt now plainly, that this faith which we haue in Chriſt, commeth by
the preaching of the Goſpell, as Paule affirmeth Rom. 10: <hi>Faith is by
hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Here, here I ſay doth all the
force conſiſt, by the word of God, not by the worde of man. The word of God
doth theſe thinges, not when we publiſh indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or preach of workes,
as hitherto (alas) it hath bene done, to our exceeding loſſe, as well in
the good thinges of the body as of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule. We made no account of goods
which we beſtowed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, vnles we had afflicted our body with
faſtings, chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pilgrimages, and ſuch like trifles. In deede
theſe thinges had bene to be graunted and borne, if they had not with a
falſe confidence in ſuch doing, ſo miſerably and lamentably led vs
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp; ſeduced vs from a true faith &amp; confidence in God through
Chriſt. But praiſe be vnto God, that we haue for the moſt parte perceiued
ſuch deluſions. For the world was ſo full of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and
preaching, that it did almoſt ouerflow, which ſurely came by the vengeance
and wrath of God, for that we contemned his word, and followed mens fables, yea
our owne wittes and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Then we were in ſo great blindnes, that we did
almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference beleeue euery man, what kind of worke ſoeuer he
brought and gloriouſly ſet forth. From theſe deceitfull follies our
conſciences are nowe deliuered and ſet free, but no man doth ſo much as
once giue thanks to God therefore. If we ſhal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteouſly negligent,
a more grieuous miſerie ſhall light vpon vs then this was. Neither ſhould
that come vnto vs vndeſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, foraſmuch as we doe greatly procure
theſe euills againſt our ſelues by our vnthankefulnes. When as before we
gaue with ſo great aboundance and plentye, that by our liberalitie they were
made almoſt Lordes of the world, nowe hardly ſix or ſeuen poore men are
maintained in a citie, yea nowe the Miniſter of a Pariſh Church hath not
ſufficient wherewith to liue. Howbeit doe not impute this peruerſe kind of
liuing to the Goſpell, as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries nowe impudently doe. It is not
meete, that thou ſuffer thy poore neighbour by thee to neede: Yea rather the
whole Goſpel doth ſpecially vrge this, that thou haue a care of thy
neighbour, and that thou be ſeruiceable toward him, that thou help him both
with thy counſell, and ſubſtance, euen as God hath holpen and 
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:9413:236"/> inſtructed thee.</p>
               <p>Such a one without dout he that is endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true faith
ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him ſelfe: for he burſteth forth,<note place="margin">The faithful
man exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth charitie toward his neighbour.</note> and behaueth him
ſelfe ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward others, as he hath tried God towardes him ſelfe, and as
he deſireth to be done to him ſelfe, if he were preſſed with pouertie,
anguiſh, and neceſſitie. God needeth not our good workes, our prayers,
faſtings, and buildings of temples, founding of Maſſes, doe diſpleaſe
him, he requireth not our ſacrifices, but rather as Eſay ſayth, hateth
and abhorreth them. He is content with this one thing, that we acknowledge him
for our God, truſt in him, &amp; giue him thankes, as he ſayth Pſal. 50:
<hi>Heare, O my people, &amp; I will ſpeake, I my ſelfe will teſtifie
againſt thee O Iſraell: for I am God euen thy God. I will not reproue thee,
becauſe of thy ſacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings: becauſe they were
not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay before me. I vvill take no bullocke out of thy houſe, nor he
goates out of thy foldes. For all the beaſts of the foreſt are mine, and
ſo are the cattels vpon a thouſand hils. I knovv all the ſoules vpon the
mountaines, and the vvild beaſts of the field are in my ſight. If I be
hungrie, I vvill not tell thee: for the vvhole vvorlde is myne and all that is
therein. Thinkeſt thou that I vvill eate bulles flesh, and drinke the blood

Iewes ſaid to the Prophets, which referred all thinges to the Gentiles, the
wordes going before do ſufficiently ſhew, vnto whom, or of whom theſe
wordes of Chriſt are ſpoken. For before he ſpeaketh of them that contemne
the Goſpell, not vouchſafeing to embrace it, whoſe dutie
notwithſtanding eſpecially was to embrace it, inaſmuch as they would
ſeeme alone to be them, that were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied <pb n="458" facs="tcp:9413:238"/> in the
word of God, and were to be counted for the people of God. Of ſuch he
ſayeth thus: <hi>Whereunto shall I liken this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? it is like vnto
litle children which ſit in the markets, and call vnto their fellowes, and
ſay: we haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced: we haue mourned vnto
you, and ye haue not lamented.</hi> Which the Lord applieth to himſelfe, and
vnto Iohn the Baptiſt: as if he would ſay: we haue preached vnto you the
Goſpell: Iohn with a certaine ſeueritie and auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but I with verie
great clemencie and gentlenes. But ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne our preaching and will not
receiue it, ye ſhall at the laſt feele without dout to your great euell,

               <p>Theſe the Lord calleth here wiſe, and men of

is nothing els but the knowledge of God,<note place="margin">True wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
what it is. Prudence.</note> to wit, when as I know what we muſt thinke of
God, and do vnderſtand his will. But prudence ſignifieth abilitie and

often ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth togither, eſpecially in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians chap.
1. and in his Epiſtle to the Coloſſians chap. 1. Of ſuch wiſedome
Chriſt ſpeaketh not here, but of worldly wiſedome, which puffeth vp men,
and excludeth the true wiſedome of God. We are all of this diſpoſition by
nature, eftſoones to riſe againſt the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Humane or worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>That is
called good, by the inſtinct of humane wiſedome, which bringeth pleaſure,
honour, and profite, but thoſe thinges that are contrarie to theſe, as
affliction, diſhonour, loſſe, thoſe are called euill. For mans nature
can ſeeke nothing els at all, but thoſe things that are his owne, that
which pleaſeth and profiteth him, that he doth eſpecially like: But that
which diſpleaſeth him, he counteth the worſt of all thinges, although it
be the beſt. Wherefore as I haue ſaide, the Lord ſpeaketh here of thoſe
wiſe and prudent men, which with their owne wiſedom ſtriue againſt the
wiſedome of God. Worldly wiſedome ſeemeth to it ſelfe to 
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:9413:238"/> be ſo great, that is it not content to rule onely
theſe worldly and temporall thinges, but taketh alſo vpon it ſelfe to
haue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of heauenly things, it alwayes ſercheth out and
imagineth ſome new thing, euen in ſpirituall and diuine matters. So mans
owne wiſedome hath inuented ſhauen crownes and cowles, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all
that, wherein the papacie conſiſteth, euerie one hath choſen his proper
worke to himſelfe, this man hath inuented this, an other hath inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that,
and if this be aboliſhed, and doth not greatly pleaſe, byandby they fynde
out ſome other thing, as (alas) we haue ſeene, and do as yet ſee, neither
is there any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in theſe trifles, whereupon it commeth, that we can
hardly away with the word of God and the truth, but are alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to
inuent ſome new thing. For truly this is certaine, as often as we ordaine a
new worſhip of God contrarie to the word of God, we are byandby blynded, and
fall from errour to errour, then which calamitie none greater can come vnto vs.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule 2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. ſayth: <hi>Therefore God shall
ſend them ſtrong deluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they should beleeue lies, that all they
might be damned which beleeued not the truth, but had pleaſure in
vnrighteouſnes.</hi> Yea and at the laſt they become ſo blynde, that they
vnderſtand nothing at all of God, as it is in the 14. Pſal. <hi>The foole
hath ſayd in his heart, there is no God.</hi> For it can not be that the
naturall man, which conſiſteth of fleſh &amp; blood, and is not
inſtructed by the ſpirit of God, ſhould iudge and vnderſtand thoſe
thinges which are of God, as Paule 1. Cor. 2. witneſſeth: <hi>The naturall
man perceiueth not the thinges of the Spirite of God: for they are foolishnes
vnto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually
decerned.</hi> He which wil reade more hereof, let him peruſe the firſt
chapter of the Epiſtle of Paule to the Romanes, there ſhall he plainly
enough perceiue, what blyndenes is, and what puniſhment doth enſue, if the
word of God beinge neglected, we folowe our one inuentions and counſels.</p>
               <p>All which we ſee in our ſpirituall monkes, nunnes, and
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing priſtes, and do too truly trie it. God graunt that they may at
the laſt repent, and giue vnto God his glorie. S. Paule ſayth there of the
Gentiles, that they turned the glorie of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God to the
ſimilitude of the image, not onely of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, but alſo of
birdes, and foure footed beaſtes, and of <pb n="460" facs="tcp:9413:239"/> creeping
thinges. So do our Papiſts alſo, yea and much more fooliſhly and madly
then the Gentiles: for they make vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a good which is delighted
with a ſhauen crowne, with towels, with eating of fleſh and fiſh, &amp;c.
Wherefore God hath giuen them vp through their hearts luſts vnto vncleannes,
as he did the Gentiles, and that ſo filthily, that it is better to conceale
it, then to rehearſe it. For if ſuch filthie and wicked thinges were
committed among the Gentiles, which had many wiues and many concubines, what
would not theſe ſpirituall men com-Briefly which haue forbidden the vſe
of women and matrimonie? mit, ſo is it wont to come to paſſe, where Satan
beareth the ſwaie, and the word of God is wreſted to ſerue mens
affections, which euerie man may aſſuredly perſwade himſelfe to be
ſo, yea theſe thinges are ſo knowen and vndoutedly true, that children in
the ſtretes ſpeake and ſing of them. Now this is not to be vnderſtood
of ſpirituall men onely, but euen the vulgar ſort and common multitude do
liue ſo, when the word of God is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. As we ſee citizens to vtter
counterfet wares, marchants to deceiue in ſelling marchandice, and ſo many
craftie practizes, ſo many deceits in ſubtill dealing, ſo much regard of
vſurie and priuate profit, that it can not be rehearſed. As yet they
endeuour againe to bring in the Maſſe, to ſet vp their tapers &amp;c:
being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God is pacified with ſuch trifles, reuoluing this
onely in their myndes, that their fame may remaine vntouched and vnhurt in the
world, howſoeuer they agree with God. Of ſuch wiſe and prudent men
Chriſt ſpeaketh here in the Goſpell, which heare the Goſpell in deede,
and ſee miracles, but it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them nothing, foraſmuch as their heart
is not touched. Now Chriſt ſayth thus:</p>

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:9413:239"/> there may be a ruſticall felow, whom he calleth here
wiſe and prudent. In the eight Pſal. Dauid alſo calleth theſe infants
and children, when he ſayth: <hi>Out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings

by whom God ordained ſtrength againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which ſhould extoll
his glorie through the whole world, were not babes or children in verie deede.
Thoſe therefore the Lord calleth children here, which compt their owne workes
for nothing, attribute nothing to their owne wiſedome,<note place="margin">Whom
the Lord calleth here childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or babes.</note> make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of themſelues,
but thinke God onely to be wiſe and of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Wherefore they are
humble and lowly, and how great ſoeuer they are, do ſubmit themſelues to
God, of whom onely they ſuffer themſelues to be taught. Now other be ouer
wiſe, and will learne nothing of God, yea they preſumptuouſly take to
themſelues iudgement and cenſure ouer the doctrine and workes of God,
whereof thou mayſte read in the firſt and ſecond chapter of the Epiſtle
to the Corinthians. Wherefore Chriſt ſayth Luke 16: <hi>The children of
this world are in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wiſer then the children of light.</hi>
But the fooliſh children of light are of greater eſtimation before God,
then the wiſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world. Of theſe children the Lord
ſpeaketh: <hi>Thou haſt hid them from the wiſe and men of
vnderſtanding, and haſt reuealed them to babes.</hi> For the wiſe and
prudent know not theſe thinges, but the children and fooles know them. How
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe that the wiſe know them not? becauſe thou haſt
hidden them from them. How do the children know them? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt
reuealed them. What he meaneth hereby, we may gather of thoſe thinges that
were ſpoken before, to wit that he had preached the Goſpell of the kingdome
of God in many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Iudea, as in Chorazin, Bethſaida, and in his owne
citie Capernaum, which cities their owne wiſedome being a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and
lette vnto them, did not receiue the fooliſh preaching of the Goſpell. The
Goſpel is a good and ioyfull meſſage, which teacheth me to know the
glorie of God, by which knowledge I obtaine pardon of my ſynnes, and life
eternall:<note place="margin">The Goſpell a ioyful meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</note> As
Chriſt ſayth to his father in the Goſpell of Iohn chap. 17: <hi>This is
life eternal, that they know thee to be the onely very God, and Ieſus
Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> He ſaythe alſo in this Goſpell:
<hi>No man knoweth the Sonne but the Father, neither knoweth any man 
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:9413:240"/> the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reueale him.</hi> Here he ſpeaketh of the knowledge both of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and of the Sonne. To whom this is reuealed, he knoweth, and obtaineth eternal
life. But the Father hath hid theſe thinges from the wiſe and prudent, that
they may not know neither the Father nor the Sonne, and hath reuealed them to
children, they haue the knowledge both of the Father and the Sonne, and ſo do
obtaine euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if theſe thinges be thus, as they be in deede, what
ſhall become of free will? Seeing thou ſeeſt ſuch hainous and wicked
thinges to be committed in the bodies, as it is written Rom. 1. go thy wayes
now, and glorie of free will. But this is a goodly free will, to liue in ſuch
a filthie life, which is altogether vnworthy of a man, which is vnknowen euen
among beaſtes that are without reaſon. Howbeit it is wont ſo to come to
paſſe, when God forſaketh vs.<note place="margin">What ſtate they come
into, whom God forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note> As ſoone as we are forſaken of God,
byandby Satan commeth, and erecteth his kingdome in vs, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els
but ſuch wickedneſſes are committed, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are ſo
craftely coloured, and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of honeſtie, that it

mans ſtrength do here? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome go about to bring to paſſe many
thinges, ſweetely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelues that they ſhall aſcend vp
into heauen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But thou heareſt here that Chriſt affirmeth, that the
Father doth reueale theſe thinges: alſo that it is the good pleaſure of
the Father that it ſhould be ſo. Whereby truly he taketh away all the
merits of man, here no ſatiſfactions profit, here is no reſpect of
workes, it is done by the wil and good pleaſure of the Father. For he
reſpecteth not the perſon, as it appeareth before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. He doth not
contemne and reiect the ſynner, albeit he come laden with ſinnes. After the
ſame ſort Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples Luke 12: <hi>Feare not litle
flocke, for it is the Fathers pleaſure to giue you the kingdome.</hi> This
the hypocrites and iuſtitiaries can not abyde, yea they are driuen vnto
furie, ſenſſeſnes, and madnes, when they ſee ſimple receiuers of
cuſtome and verie publicans to go before them into the kingdome of heauen,
they themſelues with their holines, &amp; goodly and plauſible workes to
the world, being excluded: whom would not this driue vnto madnes? who would not
take it grieuouſly, that he himſelfe and his thinges <pb n="463" facs="tcp:9413:240"/>
ſhould be in ſuch a caſe, and nothing at all counted of? But what
ſhouldeſt thou do, or what ſhouldeſt thou murmur? The good pleaſure
of God is ſuch, to whom he vouchſaueth to open, to him they ſhalbe
opened: and from whom he hideth, from him they are hidden, which compt as
vndoutedly true: And marke well that Chriſt ſayth here, It is ſo, O
Father, becauſe thy good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was ſuch, thy good pleaſure I ſay,
before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world was made, as S. Paule ſayth Epheſ. 1: <hi>God hath

tempt him with this and <pb n="464" facs="tcp:9413:241"/> that vice, as, with adulterie,
whoredome, theft, ſlaughter, enuie, hatred, wrath, and other like ſynnes.
But let him not therefore be diſcouraged, he hath a king, that is ſtrong
&amp; mightie enough, of whom he ſhalbe eaſily defended. Notwithſtanding
it wilbe verie hard to ſtand ſtrongly, and nothing to yeelde, wherefore
prayer in this caſe is verie needefull, others alſo may by their prayers
intreat for thee, that a ſtout corage and manly heart may be giuen vnto thee,
to withſtand Satan. But it is certaine, that thou ſhalt not be deſtitute,
Chriſt will eaſily preſerue thee, be not diſquieted in mynde, let it
onely be thy care, that thou falleſt not from his kingdome. Moreouer in this
Goſpell thou ſeeſt, that Chriſt is both God &amp; man: Man, inaſmuch
as he prayſeth God, and giueth him thankes: God, inaſmuch as all thinges
are giuen vnto him of the Father. Which ought to be great comfort vnto vs in
all things that do trouble and afflict vs. Whereas he ſaith: <hi>No man
knoweth the Sonne but the Father: neither knoweth any man the Father but the
Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will reueale him:</hi> he in theſe wordes
ouerthroweth free will, which will know God and Chriſt, when and how it
pleaſeth it. Here thou haſt plainly, from whence the knowledge of God and
of Chriſt is: the Father, ſaith he, knoweth the Sonne, and the Sonne the
Father, but how do we know, by this or that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? no truly, theſe are
onely certaine midle inſtruments, but he onely knoweth, to whom the Sonne
will reueale. A litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaide that the Father doth reueale or open,
here he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth the ſame to the Sonne. Surely both the Father and the
Sonne do reueale, and as the Father reuealeth, ſo alſo doth the Sonne: and
Chriſt alſo ſayth in Iohn chap. 14: The holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you
all thinges. Wherefore as the Father teacheth, ſo teacheth the Sonne,
likewiſe alſo teacheth the holy Ghoſt. And where God the Father, and the
Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt do not teach, there all thinges remaine voide of
knowledge. It followeth moreouer in the Goſpell.</p>

               <p>Hitherto we haue heard how the Lord dealeth with the wiſe and
prudent, namely that he blyndeth them, and hideth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell from them.
Likewiſe how he is delighted in children and ſimple ones, to wit, that he
endueth them with right knowledge of himſelfe, and openeth the Goſpell vnto
them. But ſome man may here ſay and complaine: If the matter be ſo,
ſurely my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhalbe in great daunger, before I heare and know
that the Goſpell dothe pertaine vnto me. I am a wretched ſynner, and
perhaps the Goſpell pertaineth not vnto me, what if I be vnworthie? Chriſt,
that he may comfort theſe weake, diſmayed, and troubled conſciences,
ſayth: <hi>Come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden, and I will refresh
you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What ſoeuer burden we are laden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, we may finde
eaſe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in chriſt, if we flie to him for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</note>
Here are we called vnto comfort. Here forget all thy merit and worthines, for
that he plainly ſayth: <hi>ye that are wearie and laden,</hi> to wit, with
the burden of the lawe, the anguiſhe and affliction of ſynne, and
wherewithall ſoeuer the conſcience maye be troubled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dothe
not expreſſe it by name: for he ſaythe not, ye that are troubled with
this or that calamitie, but ſimplie, ye that are wearie and laden. Neither
will he haue any here exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, foraſmuch as he ſaythe, <hi>All,</hi>
which is a ſingular and ſpeciall comfort, if any thinge trouble vs, what
kynde of tentation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be.</p>
               <p>Who ſoeuer therefore is ſtriken with the feelinge of his
ſynne, and knoweth his one weakenes to fulfill the lawe of God, let him come
hither with a cheerefull and bold corage, and he ſhall certainly receiue
comfort. I will refreſh you, ſayth Chriſt, as thoſe that are
preſſed and burdened with ſore labour and griefe. Let this onely be thy
care, that thou beleeue ſuch a louing bidding and promiſe. After this
ſorte Chriſt cryed in the temple at Hieruſalem at a certaine feaſt:
<hi>If any man thirſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.37.38.39.</note> 
                  <hi>let
him come vnto me, and drinke. He that beleeueth in me, as ſayth the
Scripture, out of his bellie shall flow riuers of water of life. This ſpake
he of the Spirit, which they that beleeued in him, should receiue.</hi> Which
ſo commeth to paſſe: He cauſeth the Goſpel to be preached vnto vs,
which he that beleeueth, is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the holy Ghoſt, and obtaineth pardon
of all his ſynnes. <pb n="466" facs="tcp:9413:242"/> This is truly to refreſh him,
whoſe conſcience is troubled, to wit, when he feeleth that his ſynnes be
forgiuen, and that he is become heire of the kingdome of God. Neither doth he
refreſh vs onely in the anguiſh and tentation of ſynne, but he will
alſo be preſent with vs in other calamities and miſeries, in famine,
warre, dearth of victuals, and whatſoeuer ſuch like can come, in all
theſe he will not leaue vs deſtitute of his helpe, as he cared for the
Patriarke Ioſeph, euen in a ſtraunge countrie, with whom he was continually
preſent, as well in proſperitie as in aduerſitie. Nowe ſynne is a
grieuous burden, whereof no man is eaſed, but he whom Chriſt the ſonne of
God deliuereth, and that by the holy Ghoſt, whom he hath merited for vs of
the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which maketh our hearts cheerefull, and readie to do all thinges
which God requireth of vs.</p>
               <p>But what is this that he ſayth? <hi>Take my yoke on you.</hi>
Is this to refreſh, if I take one burden from one, and lay vpon him an
other?<note place="margin">The yoke of Chriſt why ſo called.</note> This is
that, whereof we haue oftentimes ſpoken, the Goſpell doth firſt make
aſtonied and diſcourage, and is grieuous to the fleſh, for it telleth vs
that all our owne thinges are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that our owne holines and
righteouſnes are of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, that all thinges which are in vs are
damned, that we are the children of wrath and indignation. This is verie hard,
and an intolerable burden to the fleſhe, and therefore he calleth it a burden
or yoke. But leſt he ſhould terrifie or make afrayde any, for that he is of
great authoritie, high, and mightie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can not ſuffer ſynneful
and wretched men, or for that he may ſeeme to be tyrannicall and vngentle, he
before cutting of this ſuſpicion, ſayth: <hi>Learne of me: for I am meeke
and lowly in heart.</hi> Chriſt will here louingly allure vs to his doctrine,
for he had ſpoken before of the knowledge of the Father, as if he would
ſaye: fleſhe and a fearfull nature compteth me for an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, ſeuere,
and rigorous man, but I am not of ſuch a nature, yea I am humble and meeke in
heart.<note place="margin">Chriſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; meeke.</note> I do not terrifie
men as Moſes dothe, I doe not preach: doe this or that, but I preach
forgiuenes of ſynnes, neither doe I preach that they ſhould giue any
thinge, but rather that they may receiue. There is not in me ambition and
loftines, as is in the Phariſes, which deſire to be magnified, but I am
altogither gentle and lowly in heart, ready to receiue ſynners. If ſo be
that they fall againe into <pb n="467" facs="tcp:9413:242"/> ſynnes, notwithſtanding I
doe not yet caſt them from me, if they flie vnto me for ſuccour, and doe
with a ſure confidence looke for comfort and helpe of me. I doe not curſe
men as the Phariſes doe, which curſe them euen for their owne ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and for mens deuiſes, and will ſooner ſuffer all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of
God to be neglected, then one of their decrees and ordinaunces not to be
obſerued. As we ſee in the Papacie, where it is counted a greater offence
to eate fleſh on the frydaye, or for a ſacrificing Prieſt to marie, them
to commit twentie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries or ten homicides. But here thou ſeeſt that
God doth abrogate euen his owne lawe, that he may ſo much the ſooner
procure ſynners vnto him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in a ſingular ſignification ſayth here, that he
is meeke, as if he ſaide: I knowe how ſynners are to be handled, I haue
tryed what a fearefull and an afflicted conſcience is, as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to
the Hebreues chapter 5. witneſſeth, that he was in all thinges tempted in
like ſort, except ſynne. Wherefore let no man be afrayd of me, I will
handle all eaſily and gently, I will ſaye nothinge with a ſowre
contenaunce, I make no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde, ſo as they come boldly vnto me, they
ſhall fynde reſt to their ſoules with me. To their ſoules he
ſayth,<note place="margin">They that beleeue in Chriſt finde reſt to their
ſoules, though in their bodies they ſuffer affliction.</note> as if he
would ſaye: outwardly in the bodie there maye be affliction and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and
calamities may ouerwhelme you, but ye ought to beare all theſe thinges
lightely, as he alſo ſayth to his diſciples in the Goſpell of Iohn:
<hi>In me ye shall haue peace, but in the world ye shall haue affliction.</hi>
Wherefore although outwardly all thinges fall out againſt vs, as though they
would ſuppreſſe and deuour vs, yet are they nothinge to be eſteemed of:
For we haue the feelinge of peace inwardly in our conſcience. And this is the
firſt frute of fayth, as Paule ſaythe Rom. 5: <hi>Therefore being
iuſtified by fayth we haue peace toward God through our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> Nowe when our conſcience is quieted, and we haue peace with
God, nothinge is able to moue vs, no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall hurt vs, albeit it be
euell and againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Let no man thinke thus, and ſaye: this is not to amend ones
ſtate or caſe, if I take one burden from his necke, and laye on an other,
as it is before ſayd. For Chriſt ſayth: <hi>My yoke is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and my
burden is light,</hi> as if he would ſaye: the yoke of the law, vnder which
ye liued before, was grieuous to be borne, <pb n="468" facs="tcp:9413:243"/> but my burden
is not ſo grieuous, it is light, and tolerable, ye may eaſily beare it. Our
wiſemen ſaye now, that the yoke of Chriſt is more grieuous, then the yoke
of the Lawe was, and they alleage the fift chapter of Matthewe. But Chriſt
dothe there interprete the Lawe, how it ought to be vnderſtood, he doth not
make lawes, but ſayth, that murders and adulteries proceede from an euell and
vncleane heart. And ſo he doth onely expounde the Lawe of Moſes, and
preſcribeth not any lawes there.<note place="margin">Why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yoke of Chriſt
is ſaide to be eaſie.</note> But the yoke of Chriſt is therefore eaſie,
and his burden light, becauſe he taketh awaye, not onely ceremoniall and mans
lawes, but euen the whole lawe, the curſe, ſynne, death, and what ſoeuer
maye come vnto vs from the Lawe, all this Chriſt taketh awaye from me, and
endueth me with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the motion and inſtinct whereof, I doe
gladly, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with pleaſure performe all the duties of the Lawe. It
is therefore alſo called eaſie, ſweete, and light, for that he
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe helpeth vs, and taketh part of the burden, if we be not of
ſtrength ſufficient. It appeareth in deede grieuous and intolerable to the
world, but it is otherwiſe when there is one ready to eaſe the burden. It
is a common ſaying: it is good to ſing with a fit compaino<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you two will
eaſily beare the burden, although one alone were not of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gh
ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to beare it. Thus much ſhall ſuffize for the expoſition of
this Goſpell. *** *</p>

This is the chiefe and the greateſt thing in this Goſpell, vnto which all
are to be referred. Hereof we ought to learne, that we are not iuſtified by
our owne ſtrength, neither ſaued by our owne merits, but are ſanctified
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of Chriſt, and ſaued by grace, &amp; that Chriſt is the
way leading to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>We will diſcuſſe and examine this Goſpell throughout, as
God ſhall giue vs grace. Theſe wordes the Lord ſpake vnto his Diſciples
after his Supper, when he was now about to depart from them. Foraſmuch as he
had ſaid many thinges vnto them of his departure and paſſion, they were
after a ſort troubled and terrified, wherefore the Lord beginneth louingly to
comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying: <hi>Let not your heart be troubled.</hi> As if he would
ſay: I perceiue that my departure dothe grieue you, and that ye are therefore
troubled: But ſeeing it can not be otherwiſe, be not diſcomforted, there
is no cauſe why ye ſhould therefore be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I will come againe vnto
you. Notwithſtanding ye ſhall ſee many thinges in me before, whereat ye
wilbe offended, they ſhal crucifie me and vnworthely handle me. But be not ye
troubled becauſe of theſe thinges, be not afrayde, it wilbe better
ſhortly after, the will of the Father is ſuch. Howbeit fleſh can not do 
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:9413:245"/> otherwiſe but be offended, if it ſeeth Chriſt to
be crucified, it by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andby reuolteth from him, it beleeueth him not neither
counteth him for a Sauiour. Which alſo it doth, when it ſeeth holy men
ſuffer perſecution, to be afflicted and tormented, for then it thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that God hath no care of them. Againſt this offence Chriſt aforehand
confirmeth his Diſciples, and ſayth: <hi>Ye beleeue in God, beleeue alſo
in me.</hi> That is, ye beleeue that God loueth you and will glorifie you,
beleeue that he will do it after that ſort, that ye ſee me glorified, and
beleeue that this my death is life, to the glorifying both of me, and of my
whole body, that is, of all Chriſtians, and that this death ſatiſfieth
for the ſynnes of the world, as the Apoſtles afterward witneſſed of him
in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges.<note place="margin">1. Iohn 2.2.</note> Thus Iohn ſayth:
<hi>Chriſt is the reconciliation for our ſynnes: and not for ours onely,
but alſo for the ſynnes of the whole worlde.</hi> Wherefore thou ſeeſt
that Chriſt here will haue heartes confirmed by faith, and by no other
outward thinge. He ſayth moreouer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many dwelling places.</hi> Theſe

neede that they ſhould be prepared of him. Why therefore doth he ſay: <hi>I
go to prepare a place for you?</hi> This is nothinge els but that he goeth and
is made Lord of all, whereby he may prepare vs vnto ſuch dwelling places. For
as long as we are not prepared, neither are the dwelling places prepared for
vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be ready by themſelues. Wherefore Chriſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus
much: There are dwelling places, but not yet prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rightly and as they
muſt be. Howbeit then ſhal they be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared and appointed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as
I haue taken away the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of death by my death, and am now gone to
reigne, and that by the holy Ghoſt: which by fayth ſhall prepare and wholy
make ready you alſo vnto ſuch dwelling places. So that this is the ſimple
and plaine meaning of theſe wordes: There are dwelling places, to wit, where
the Father glorifieth, but thoſe dwelling places are not yet prepared, for
that the kingdome of death is not yet taken away. This Chriſt ſignifieth
when he ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it were not ſo I would haue told you: I go to prepare a
place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and
receiue you vnto my ſelfe, that where I am, there may ye be alſo.</hi> In
theſe wordes the Lord declareth how theſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <pb n="473" facs="tcp:9413:245"/>
places be prepared, namely, by the death of Chriſt as it is ſayde, by which
he came vnto glorie, and ruleth ouer all thinges, which are in heauen and
earth. By which death he hath obtayned the holy Ghoſt for vs, which as is
before ſayde, may prepare vs vnto theſe dwelling places. For through his
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and working in vs, he maketh vs beleeue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, by which
beleeuing or faith we are prepared. Which could not be done if Chriſt
ſhould not depart and dye, and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe a kingdome ouer all.
This therefore is the ſumme of this text: They are foreſeene, whome the
Father will glorifie, but they can not be glorified but by Chriſt, who vnles
he take away death and ſinne, all ſhall be in vaine. Here thou ſeeſt
that all tend vnto this, that Chriſt is he which prepareth the dwelling
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that we can not be glorified but by Chriſt, ſo that the whole
drift of this text is, that we are not iuſtified by mans ſtrength, nor by
our owne merits, but by Chriſt, which the whole Epiſtle to the Romanes
effectually declareth, as alſo that which is written to the Galathians, &amp;
almoſt all that Paule doth in his Epiſtles, tendeth to the ſame ende. It
followeth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whither I goe ye knowe, and the way ye knowe.</hi> For
ye beleeue in me, and haue ſhewed ſignes in my name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye ought nowe
to be certaine who I am, and what I doe, and wherefore I am come. Ye haue
alſo ſeene and heard the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Father of me. Wherefore ye
may nowe knowe that the Father will glorifie me, and beleeue that I and the
Father are one, it ſhoulde be therefore ſuperfluous to ſpeake more of
theſe thinges. But the Diſciples albeit they were well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the
Lorde him ſelfe, and had ſeene his miracles, yea and they them ſelues
alſo had preached the Goſpell and wrought miracles, were notwithſtanding
as yet ſomewhat groſſe in vnderſtanding, neither did they perceiue
whereof he here ſpake, and what was that way, and whither the Lorde did
prepare to depart. Wherefore Thomas burſteth forth into open wordes and
confeſſeth freely, that he is ignorant hereof, and ſayth thus vnto the
Lord: <hi>Lord we knowe not whither thou goeſt: hovve can we then knovve the
vvay?</hi> Here ye heare and ſee, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it there was faith in the
Diſciples, notwithſtanding they were not as yet perſuaded that Chriſt
ſhoulde be crucified, and <pb n="474" facs="tcp:9413:246"/> by his death ſhoulde enter
into his kingdome, and that the ſame kingdom ſhould be ſpirituall, which
they did not vnderſtand euen after the reſurrection of the Lord:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Lorde,</hi> ſay they, <hi>wilt thou at this time reſtore
the kingdom to Iſraell?</hi> Thoſe good men were as yet perſuaded, that
it ſhould be a carnall &amp; worldly kingdom. Such groſſe things may here
and there be found in the Goſpels, by meanes whereof the Diſciples did
ſometime notably ſtumble and erre.<note place="margin">Comfort for them that
be weake in faith and ſometime through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie fall.</note> All which
were committed to writing for our comfort &amp; confirmation, that we ſhould
not be by and by diſcouraged, when we haue ſometime ſtumbled in faith,
and can not at the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelues to the workes and word of the
Lorde. If this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to theſe great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which afterward ſhoulde become
pillers of Chriſtianitie, there is no cauſe truely that any ſhould
meruell, if we alſo ſometime faint in faith, yea, and let no man be afrayd,
although it falleth out that ſometime through infirmitie he ſo doe. It is
the worke and matter of the Lorde, he will amend theſe thinges when it
ſeemeth good vnto him.</p>
               <p>Now of the wordes we mind to entreate ſomewhat at large. Not
much before, when Chriſt would confirme his Diſciples in faith, he
promiſed them that they ſhould be glorified. Here he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and declareth
how and by what meanes they muſt be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, affirming that that muſt be
by his departure, that is, by his death, &amp; that by that meane he muſt
obtaine his kingdome. This he had often repeated vnto them, ſo that now it
did become them to know and vnderſtand it. Therefore he ſayth: <hi>VVhither
I goe ye know, and the way ye knowe,</hi> but they did not yet throughly
vnderſtand it, as the wordes of Thomas doe declare. Now, it is certaine that
there was faith in the Diſciples, which the wordes of Peter proue, who
aunſwered Chriſt in ſteede of the reſt, when he aſked them, whether
they alſo would goe away: Peter ſayd: <hi>Maiſter to whom shall we
goe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.68.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt the
wordes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: and we beleeue and knowe that thou art Chriſt the
Sonne of the liuing God.</hi> This appeareth alſo by the wordes of the Lord,
which he had ſayd to them a litle before at his ſupper: <hi>Ye are
cleane,</hi> which he would not haue ſayd, if they had not bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: they
knewe Chriſt therefore that he is the way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So they knew the
Father alſo, for that they had ſeene the miracles whereby he gaue
teſtimonie of the Sonne, and had heard the voyce of the Father from heauen:
<hi>This is my beloued <pb n="475" facs="tcp:9413:246"/> Sonne, in whom I am well
pleaſed, heare him.</hi> All theſe thinges did greatly increaſe faith in
the Diſciples hearts, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they did not yet vnderſtand, what
they ſhould doe, and what ende concerning the matters of Chriſt was to be
hoped for.</p>
               <p>Set before you an example hereof in Abraham. Although in faith a
ſonne was conceiued vnto him, neuertheles he was yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that he
muſt be offered: Neither did faith manifeſtly ſhew it ſelfe, when a
ſonne was giuen vnto him. So was it alſo with the Diſciples: although
they had faith, notwithſtanding they wanted as yet triall of their faith: Now
nothing trieth faith better then the croſſe and perſecution. If Abraham
had not bene commaunded to offer his ſonne, he had had no triall of his
faith. When as the Apoſtles did ſuffer perſecution, they then had a
taſt and triall of their faith. As longe as we may liue without tentation, we
thinke that we are endued with a ſtrong faith, but if any aduerſitie
commeth to vs on any ſide, we byandby trie what faith we reſted vpon.
Wherfore S. Paul ſayth Rom. 5: <hi>VVe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in tribulations, knowing that
tribulation bringeth forth patience, &amp; patience experience, &amp;
experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed.</hi> After the ſame ſort
Salomon alſo ſayth in the Prouerbs: <hi>As ſiluer is fined, and golde
tryed in the fornace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.3.</note>
                  <hi>ſo doth the Lord trie the harts.</hi> Such a triall is made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
croſſe and perſecution, when we are as it were crucified according to our
old Adam, by which crucifying our faith is tried, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this trial
of faith our fleſh mortified, the ſpirit encreaſing in the knowledge of
Chriſt. And then is our fleſh truely mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when we ſuffer the will
of God to beare rule in vs, which is then done when we ſubmit our ſelues to
his will howſoeuer he dealeth with vs, renouncing our owne. This S. Paule
will haue vs to doe, when he ſayth thus Rom. 12: <hi>I beſeech you brethren
by the mercies of God, that ye giue vp your bodies a liuing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, holy,
acceptable vnto God, which is your reaſonable ſeruing of God. And fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not your ſelues like vnto this world, but be ye chaunged by the renuing of
your minde, that ye may proue what that good, and acceptable, and perfect vvil
of God is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Thomas thus confeſſeth that he is ignorant whither the
Lord goeth, neither knoweth the way, the Lord doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him with a
ſterne countenance, neither by and by caſteth <pb n="476" facs="tcp:9413:247"/> him
of, nor driueth him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he calleth him not either a groſſe aſſe
or oxe, as we are wont to handle the weake, but aunſwering him very
gently,<note place="margin">Chriſt the way, the truth, and the life.</note>
ſayth: <hi>I am the vvay, the truth, and the life.</hi> I, ſayth the Lord,
am the way, by which the father is gone vnto, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I be ſlayne: I cary
them that beleeue and are my ſheepe, on my ſhoulders to the Father: no
other way beſide this leadeth vnto heauen. He that walketh not this way,
goeth out of the way from the Father. I alſo am the truth. For I am the light
which lightneth the worlde, and I teach true doctrine, and make true
Chriſtians. Moreouer, I alſo am the life, for it is I that quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he
that beleeueth in me ſhall not dye. This, as I ſayd before, is to teach the
Goſpell rightly, that is, to ſhew the true and right way, which leadeth
vnto eternall life. When the Diſciples knew not the way that leadeth vnto
glory, the Lorde making no delay, affirmeth vnto them that he is that way. As
if he ſhould ſay: If ye deſire to know the way to glory, ſeeke not the
ſtrength, light, and righteouſnes of creatures, but looke vnto me: for I am
the way, the truth, and the life, although I muſt be put to death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am vile and of no reputation according to the outward appearance: neither let
this offend you, that they which be mine, are ſubiect to perſecutions. The
right way to the father is found in me, let none remoue you from this
perſwaſion. Therefore he ſayth moreouer:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man commeth vnto the Father but by me.</hi> As if he
ſhould ſay: No man can come to the Father by his owne ſtrength or merits:
The lawe terrifieth the conſcience that it can not goe to the Father: the
word of Chriſt, which iuſtifieth vs by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt,
bringeth vs to the Father. Whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that which he afterward
ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye had knovvne me, ye should haue knovvne my Father
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> For as no man commeth to the Father, but by the Sonne, ſo no
man knoweth the Father but by Chriſt the Sonne. Firſt the Fathers will is
not knowne, to wit, that he wil ſaue vs, vnles we ſee it in Chriſt. He
which is in the boſom of the Father, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed it vnto vs. Secondly the
Father is not beleeued. For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by it ſelfe doth not vnderſtand, that
it receiueth any thing of God. Wherefore it is needefull that Chriſt declare
that bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and goodnes vnto vs. A troubled conſcience flieth the
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither can it abide to commit it ſelf vnto him. But they that 
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:9413:247"/> are iuſtified by the word of Chriſt, do not any more
contemne the Father, neither flie him, as the Iſraelites did, but ſtande
before him as Moſes, and are enlightened with diuine light, that they may
know the power of God and mercie of the Father. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth truſt and
confidence in him: hereby we knowe that we receiue all thinges at his handes,
and looke for all as well ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual as corporal things of him. All theſe
we muſt acknowledge to be receiued by faith, reaſon can not attaine vnto
them. For it endeuoureth to obtaine God by her owne ſtrength and merits, but
that endeuour is in vaine. Wherefore when it is not able to come to the
knowledge of God by her owne ſtrength, it vtterly denieth God, and ſayth
that there is no God. After when it ſeeth vncleannes in her workes, it
deſpeireth, and is in moſt great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres. But when we are iuſtified by
fooliſh preaching, we come to the knowledge of God the Father, as ſoone as
we beleeue the word of Chriſt, and ſo we trie the power of the Father in
afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aduerſities, although they be euen great. This was
ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth in that, that the people of Iſraell could not abide to
heare the voice of God, but deſired that Moſes might ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.
Where Chriſt alſo was figured, that he ſhould make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for
vs to the Father, and be our mercy ſeat. For nature is more weake &amp;
fraile, then that it can abide to talke with God. Wherefore he hath giuen vnto
vs this his Sonne a Mediatour, in whom and by whom we muſt haue to doe with
him. When as the Lord ſo louingly and gently dealeth with Thomas, and
ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him, howe he muſt come to the Father, to wit, by the Sonne,
and that the Father is knowne in the Sonne, there doth yet happen a groſſer
thing in Philip, who burſteth forth and will not be content with faith, but
will knowe the thinge aſſuredly by feeling and ſeeing. Wherefore he
ſayth vnto the Lord:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord, shew vs thy Father, and it ſufficeth vs.</hi> As
though he would ſay, if thou wilt alſo ſhew vnto vs a ſigne, then will
we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. Philip counteth it not ſufficient to beleeue the worde, but
goeth about to come to the knowledge of the Father by an other meanes then by
the word. For ſeing that reaſon can not beleeue, he requeſteth to be
certified by an other meanes and way. By the interrogation therfore of Chriſt
that followeth it is ſhewed, that the conſcience is made certaine and quiet
by no other thing, then by faith, for that we muſt cleaue to the bare worde,
and looke for <pb n="478" facs="tcp:9413:248"/> no other ſigne. But Philip thought here
that he ſhould be much more certified, if he did ſee the Father, then if he
beleeued the ſimple and bare word. This incredulitie Chriſt reproueth
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharpely, and ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haue I bene ſo long time with you, &amp; haſt thou not
knowne me?</hi> As though he ſhould ſay: I teach and preach, and yet thou
knoweſt me not. Dooſt thou not knowe that the Father will be knowne by me,
that my word is the worde and power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by which alone he will be
knowne, and by nothing els? For thou haſt heard the voice of the Father from
heauen after this ſort: <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well
pleaſed, heare him.</hi> Dooſt thou not yet vnderſtande howe the Father
is knowne? The Father is not ſeene with carnall eyes, as Iohn in his firſt
chapter ſayth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>No man hath
ſeene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne, which is in the boſom of
the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> Wherefore the Lord ſayth to Philip:
<hi>Philip, he that hath ſeene me, hath ſeene the Father.</hi> This
ſaying is like vnto that former when he ſayth: <hi>If ye had knowne me, ye
should haue knowne my Father alſo.</hi> That is, foraſmuch as the Father
will be knowne by me, ſeeke no other way to knowe him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue my word,
that I am he, which ſheweth vnto you the Father, and will make you to know
him in me. Beleeue that by me thou haſt acceſſe to the Father, by this
meanes thou ſhalt knowe the Father, by faith thou ſhalt vnderſtande the
power and mercie of the Father, and ſhalt feele him to be comfortable and
gracious. The Father will haue my word to be beleeued, and them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it, to be ſaued and obtaine eternall life. Seeing therefore that theſe
thinges be thus, that we can not know the Father but in the Sonne, and when we
know the Sonne, we know alſo the Father: the Lord ſayth moreouer vnto
Philip:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How then ſayeſt thou: Shewe vs thy Father? Beleeueſt
thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me?</hi> As if he would
ſay: Foraſmuch as there is no other way to know the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that which
I haue ſhewed, why I pray thee, dooſt thou not beleeue my wordes, ſeeing
that I haue taught that I am the way, the truth, and the life? Dooſt thou not
beleeue that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? Beleeueſt thou not
that my diuinitie and the diuinitie of the Father is one? and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will be knowne by me? But why is the Father knowne by <pb n="479" facs="tcp:9413:248"/>
the knowledge of the Sonne? euen therefore, for that the Sonne is in the
Father, and the Father in the Sonne. For the word by which the Sonne is knowne,
is the power of the Sonne and of the Father. Wherefore ſeing the Sonne is
knowne by his word, it neceſſarily followeth, that the father alſo is
knowne thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beleeue me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in
me: at the leaſt beleeue me for the very works ſake.</hi> Here he doth as
it were appeale to workes, that they may giue teſtimonie of the word. As if
he ſhould ſay: Seeing that ye can not be content to beleeue the word, at
the leaſt beleeue the ſignes which beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the word, and whereby
the Father hath giuen teſtimonie of me. For the works and ſignes are
teſtimonies of the word. By theſe words Chriſt meaneth nothing els but to
confirme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of his Diſciples, and of all vs againſt the
offence of the croſſe. For conſciences wil know and not beleeue the bare
words of God, but doe alwayes dout and ſay: What if God careth not for thee?
and haue ſuch like cogitations. Holy &amp; godly men ſeeme for the moſt
part to be neglected, as abiects and moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, inaſmuch as
the world according to the will &amp; luſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, rageth and practizeth
tyrannie againſt them, and doth almoſt what it liſt. Hereupon they are in
anguiſh &amp; in daunger of faith, &amp; deſire to know the will of God
toward them. Theſe Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, that they may ſeeke no other
comfort but in him and in his death, and beleue that he is life, that he
beareth rule, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth aliue them that be dead. And that they ſhould
nothing dout hereof, he maketh them yet more certaine, and ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verely, verely I ſay vnto you, he that beleeueth in me,
the vvorkes that I doe, he shall doe alſo, and greater then theſe shall he
doe.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: Dout not any thing but that ye ſhall know
the Father by me, and that my word is the power of God, &amp; that by my word
ye ſhal be ſuſtained, although I be euen cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Ye ſhall haue
triall hereof in your ſelues, for if ye beleeue in me, ye ſhall not onely
worke ſuch workes and ſhew ſuch ſignes as I doe, but euen greater.
Which came to paſſe after the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, when the Apoſtles
wrought greater miracles as well among the Iewes as Gentiles, then Chriſt him
ſelfe. But what is the cauſe hereof? The Lord him ſelfe addeth it
ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I goe vnto my Father.</hi> That is, I will begin a
kingdom, where I will fulfill all thinges. Here the Lord annexeth the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion <pb n="480" facs="tcp:9413:249"/> of all the queſtions and conſolations
going before. For a litle before Chriſt had taught, that the Father is known
by him, and that is becauſe he is in the Father, he therefore is ſhewed by
that worde, by which the Father is ſhewed. But that he might confirme this,
to wit, that his worde is the power of the Father, he added and ſayd: <hi>He
that beleeueth in me, the works that I do, he shall doe alſo.</hi> That is,
by faith in me ye alſo ſhall doe thoſe works, and know that my word is
the vertue and power of God. But why doth he ſay: <hi>I goe to the
Father?</hi> I aunſwere: Becauſe Chriſt is in the Father, therefore doth
he the workes of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but we doe them not alſo therefore, but for
that Chriſt who is in the Father, is now in vs. For to goe to the Father is
to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all thinges, &amp; as Paule according to the ſaying of the
Pſalme declareth, to giue giftes vnto men, to lighten and to ſanctifie. For
this is the kingdom of Chriſt, whereby he reigneth in earth in the hartes of
the beleeuers, and ſitteth vpon the throne of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dauid. The Lord
alſo ſpeaketh theſe wordes: <hi>I goe to the Father,</hi> to comfort his
Diſciples. For as he did before beginne to confirme them, that they ſhould
not be troubled and offended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſhould dye, but courageouſly
cleaue to him, and beleue in him: So here he promiſeth them that they ſhall
be glorified, for he goeth to the Father, who ſhall deliuer all thinges into
his handes, that he may mightely obtaine a kingdom ouer all things that are in
heauen and earth. Wherefore they ought nothing at all to feare. He yet
comforteth them more and ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whatſoeuer ye aske in my name, that will I doe.</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay: As ſoone as I come to the Father, there is no
cauſe why ye ſhould be carefull. For thoſe thinges that ye haue neede of
and aſke, ye ſhall obtaine, I wil doe this for you, becauſe I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a
kingdom. And he peculiarly addeth, <hi>in my Name,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he excludeth
all our merits. For by Chriſt we are heard, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Chriſt we are
loued, by whom alſo we are Prieſtes, as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayth, to offer vp
ſpirituall ſacrifices, and acceptable to God. All theſe thinges ſayth
Chriſt, I will doe for this cauſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Father may be glorified in the Sonne.</hi> The
Father is then glorified, when glorie is giuen and aſcribed vnto him, not
vnto vs. That is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we are ſaued not by our owne
merits, not by our owne wiſedom and righteouſnes, but do put our truſt in
his mercie. For he hath giuen his Sonne for our <pb n="481" facs="tcp:9413:249"/>
ſinnes, and whatſoeuer we purpoſe to aſke, we muſt aſke it by this
Sonne, and we ſhall obtaine it. Wherfore he repeateth theſe wordes, and
ſayth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye shall aſke any thing in my Name, I will doe it.</hi>
Theſe wordes tend to this ende, that he may make vs certainely beleue his
wordes, and cleaue vnto him. This therefore is the ſumme of this
concluſion: He biddeth his Diſciples and vs therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, for that he
goeth to reigne. Before he affirmeth, that he wil ſhew forth a ſigne and
teſtimonie of his kingdom, &amp; ſo reigne, that he will declare a notable
token of his gouernment, that we may feele and perceiue it: to wit, that he
will doe ſo great works by vs, as he him ſelfe hath done, yea and greater
alſo. Alſo, that he will heare vs when we pray, and whatſoeuer we pray
for vnto the Father in his name. By theſe promiſes the hart muſt be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed &amp; made courageous againſt the gates of hell. For Chriſt
reigneth by his word, wherefore it is needefull that we exactly know the vertue
of the word: for the kingdom of Chriſt is the power &amp; vertue of God.
Theſe things I thought good to entreat of concerning this Goſpell: Let vs
call vpon God for the ayde of his grace, that we may be able to vnderſtand
them, &amp; by them to ſtrengthen our weake faith. *** *</p>
